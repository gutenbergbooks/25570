    <h2>
      I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Old Deemster Christian of Ballawhaine was a hard man&mdash;hard on the
      outside, at all events. They called him Iron Christian, and people said,
      &ldquo;Don't turn that iron hand against you.&rdquo; Yet his character was stamped
      with nobleness as well as strength. He was not a man of icy nature, but he
      loved to gather icicles about him. There was fire enough underneath, at
      which he warmed his old heart when alone, but he liked the air to be
      congealed about his face. He was a man of a closed soul. One had to wrench
      open the dark chamber where he kept his feelings; but the man who had done
      that had uncovered his nakedness, and he cut him off for ever. That was
      how it happened with his son, the father of Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had two sons; the elder was an impetuous creature, a fiery spirit, one
      of the masterful souls who want the restraint of the curb if they are not
      to hurry headlong into the abyss. Old Deemster Christian had called this
      boy Thomas Wilson, after the serene saint who had once been Bishop of Man.
      He was intended, however, for the law, not for the Church. The office of
      Deemster never has been and never can be hereditary; yet the Christians of
      Ballawhaine had been Deemsters through six generations, and old Iron
      Christian expected that Thomas Wilson Christian would succeed him. But
      there was enough uncertainty about the succession to make merit of more
      value than precedent in the selection, and so the old man had brought up
      his son to the English bar, and afterwards called him to practise in the
      Manx one. The young fellow had not altogether rewarded his father's
      endeavours. During his residence in England, he had acquired certain
      modern doctrines which were highly obnoxious to the old Deemster. New
      views on property, new ideas about woman and marriage, new theories
      concerning religion (always re-christened superstition), the usual
      barnacles of young vessels fresh from unknown waters; but the old man was
      no shipwright in harbour who has learnt the art of removing them without
      injury to the hull. The Deemster knew these notions when he met with them
      in the English newspapers. There was something awesome in their effect on
      his stay-at-home imagination, as of vices confusing and difficult to true
      men that walk steadily; but, above all, very far off, over the mountains
      and across the sea, like distant cities of Sodom, only waiting for Sodom's
      doom. And yet, lo! here they were in a twinkling, shunted and shot into
      his own house and his own stackyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose now,&rdquo; he said, with a knowing look, &ldquo;you think Jack as good as
      his master?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said his son gravely; &ldquo;generally much better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Iron Christian altered his will. To his elder son he left only a
      life-interest in Ballawhaine. &ldquo;That boy will be doing something,&rdquo; he said,
      and thus he guarded against consequences. He could not help it; he was
      ashamed, but he could not conquer his shame&mdash;the fiery old man began
      to nurse a grievance against his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two sons of the Deemster were like the inside and outside of a bowl,
      and that bowl was the Deemster himself. If Thomas Wilson the elder had his
      father's inside fire and softness, Peter, the younger, had his father's
      outside ice and iron. Peter was little and almost misshapen, with a pair
      of shoulders that seemed to be trying to meet over a hollow chest and
      limbs that splayed away into vacancy. And if Nature had been grudging with
      him, his father was not more kind. He had been brought up to no
      profession, and his expectations were limited to a yearly charge out of
      his brother's property. His talk was bitter, his voice cold, he laughed
      little, and had never been known to cry. He had many things against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides these sons, Deemster Christian had a girl in his household, but to
      his own consciousness the fact was only a kind of peradventure. She was
      his niece, the child of his only brother, who had died in early manhood.
      Her name was Ann Charlotte de la Tremouille, called after the lady of
      Rushen, for the family of Christian had their share of the heroic that is
      in all men. She had fine eyes, a weak mouth, and great timidity. Gentle
      airs floated always about her, and a sort of nervous brightness twinkled
      over her, as of a glen with the sun flickering through. Her mother died
      when she was a child of twelve, and in the house of her uncle and her
      cousins she had been brought up among men and boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Peter drew the Deemster aside and told him (with expressions of
      shame, interlarded with praises of his own acuteness) a story of his
      brother. It was about a girl. Her name was Mona Crellin; she lived on the
      hill at Ballure House, half a mile south of Ramsey, and was daughter of a
      man called Billy Ballure, a retired sea-captain, and hail-fellow-well-met
      with all the jovial spirits of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was much noise and outcry, and old Iron sent for his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this I hear?&rdquo; he cried, looking him down. &ldquo;A woman? So that's what
      your fine learning comes to, eh? Take care, sir! take care! No son of mine
      shall disgrace himself. The day he does that he will be put to the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thomas held himself in with a great effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disgrace?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What disgrace, sir, if you please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What disgrace, sir?&rdquo; repeated the Deemster, mocking his son in a mincing
      treble. Then he roared, &ldquo;Behaving dishonourably to a poor girl&mdash;that
      what's disgrace, sir! Isn't it enough? eh? eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than enough,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;But who is doing it? I'm not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you're doing worse. <i>Did</i> I say worse? Of course I said worse.
      Worse, sir, worse! Do you hear me? Worse! You are trapsing around Ballure,
      and letting that poor girl take notions. I'll have no more of it. Is this
      what I sent you to England for? Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Keep your
      place, sir; keep your place. A poor girl's a poor girl, and a Deemster's a
      Deemster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Thomas, suddenly firing up, &ldquo;and a man's a man. As for
      the shame, I need be ashamed of nothing that is not shameful; and the best
      proof I can give you that I mean no dishonour by the girl is that I intend
      to marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? You intend to&mdash;what? Did I hear&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old Deemster turned his good ear towards his son's face, and the young
      man repeated his threat. Never fear! No poor girl should be misled by him.
      He was above all foolish conventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Iron Christian was dumbfounded. He gasped, he stared, he stammered,
      and then fell on his son with hot reproaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Your wife? Wife? That trollop!&mdash;that minx! that&mdash;and
      daughter of that sot, too, that old rip, that rowdy blatherskite&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;And
      my own son is to lift his hand to cut his throat! Yes, sir, cut his throat&mdash;&mdash;And
      I am to stand by! No, no! I say no, sir, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man made some further protest, but it was lost in his father's
      clamour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will, though? You will? Then your hat is your house, sir. Take to it&mdash;take
      to it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need to tell me twice, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Away then&mdash;away to your woman&mdash;your jade! God, keep my hands
      off him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man lifted his clenched fist, but his son had flung out of the
      room. It was not the Deemster only who feared he might lay hands on his
      own flesh and blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! come back, you dog! Listen! I've not done yet. Stop! you hotheaded
      rascal, stop! Can't you hear a man out then? Come back! Thomas Wilson,
      come back, sir! Thomas! Thomas! Tom! Where is he? Where's the boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Iron Christian had made after his son bareheaded down to the road,
      shouting his name in a broken roar, but the young man was gone. Then he
      went back slowly, his grey hair playing in the wind. He was all iron
      outside, but all father within.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day the Deemster altered his will a second time, and his elder son
      was disinherited.

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peter succeeded in due course to the estate of Ballawhaine, but he was not
      a lawyer, and the line of the Deemsters Christian was broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Thomas Wilson Christian had been married to Mona Crellin without
      delay. He loved her, but he had been afraid of her ignorance, afraid also
      (notwithstanding his principles) of the difference in their social rank,
      and had half intended to give her up when his father's reproaches had come
      to fire his anger and to spur his courage. As soon as she became his wife
      he realised the price he had paid for her. Happiness could not come of
      such a beginning. He had broken every tie in making the one which brought
      him down. The rich disowned him, and the poor lost respect for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's positively indecent,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;It's potatoes marrying herrings,&rdquo;
       said another. It was little better than hunger marrying thirst.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the general downfall of his fame his profession failed him. He lost
      heart and ambition. His philosophy did not stand him in good stead, for it
      had no value in the market to which he brought it. Thus, day by day, he
      sank deeper into the ooze of a wrecked and wasted life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wife did not turn out well. She was a fretful person, with a good
      face, a bad shape, a vacant mind, and a great deal of vanity. She had
      liked her husband a little as a lover, but when she saw that her marriage
      brought her nobody's envy, she fell into a long fit of the vapours.
      Eventually she made herself believe that she was an ill-used person. She
      never ceased to complain of her fate. Everybody treated her as if she had
      laid plans for her husband's ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband continued to love her, but little by little he grew to despise
      her also. When he made his first plunge, he had prided himself on
      indulging an heroic impulse. He was not going to deliver a good woman to
      dishonour because she seemed to be an obstacle to his success. But she had
      never realised his sacrifice. She did not appear to understand that he
      might have been a great man in the island, but that love and honour had
      held him back. Her ignorance was pitiful, and he was ashamed of it. In
      earning the contempt of others he had not saved himself from
      self-contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old sailor died suddenly in a fit of drunkenness at a fair, and
      husband and wife came into possession of his house and property at
      Ballure. This did not improve the relations between them. The woman
      perceived that their positions were reversed. She was the bread-bringer
      now. One day, at a slight that her husband's people had put upon her in
      the street, she reminded him, in order to re-establish her wounded vanity,
      that but for her and hers he would not have so much as a roof to cover
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the man continued to love her in spite of all. And she was not at
      first a degraded being. At times she was bright and cheerful, and, except
      in the worst spells of her vapours, she was a brisk and busy woman. The
      house was sweet and homely. There was only one thing to drive him away
      from it, but that was the greatest thing of all. Nevertheless they had
      their cheerful hours together.
    </p>
    <p>
      A child was born, a boy, and they called him Philip. He was the beginning
      of the end between them; the iron stay that held them together and yet
      apart. The father remembered his misfortunes in the presence of his son,
      and the mother was stung afresh by the recollection of disappointed hopes.
      The boy was the true heir of Ballawhaine, but the inheritance was lost to
      him by his father's fault and he had nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip grew to be a winsome lad. There was something sweet and amiable and
      big-hearted, and even almost great, in him. One day the father sat in the
      garden by the mighty fuchsia-tree that grows on the lawn, watching his
      little fair-haired son play at marbles on the path with two big lads whom
      he had enticed out of the road, and another more familiar playmate&mdash;the
      little barefooted boy Peter, from the cottage by the water-trough. At
      first Philip lost, and with grunts of satisfaction the big ones promptly
      pocketed their gains. Then Philip won, and little curly Peter was stripped
      naked, and his lip began to fall. At that Philip paused, held his head
      aside, and considered, and then said quite briskly, &ldquo;Peter hadn't a fair
      chance that time&mdash;here, let's give him another go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father's throat swelled, and he went indoors to the mother and said,
      &ldquo;I think&mdash;perhaps I'm to blame&mdash;but somehow I think our boy
      isn't like other boys. What do you say? Foolish? May be so, may be so! No
      difference? Well, no&mdash;no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But deep down in the secret place of his heart, Thomas Wilson Christian,
      broken man, uprooted tree, wrecked craft in the mud and slime, began to
      cherish a fond idea. The son would regain all that his father had lost! He
      had gifts, and he should be brought up to the law; a large nature, and he
      should be helped to develop it; a fine face which all must love, a sense
      of justice, and a great wealth of the power of radiating happiness.
      Deemster? Why not? Ballawhaine? Who could tell? The biggest, noblest,
      greatest of all Manxmen! God knows!
    </p>
    <p>
      Only&mdash;only he must be taught to fly from his father's dangers. Love?
      Then let him love where he can also respect&mdash;but never outside his
      own sphere. The island was too little for that. To love and to despise was
      to suffer the torments of the damned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nourishing these dreams, the poor man began to be tortured by every caress
      the mother gave her son, and irritated by every word she spoke to him. Her
      grammar was good enough for himself, and the exuberant caresses of her
      maudlin moods were even sometimes pleasant, but the boy must be degraded
      by neither.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman did not reach to these high thoughts, but she was not slow to
      interpret the casual byplay in which they found expression. Her husband
      was taiching her son to dis-respeck her. She wouldn't have thought it of
      him&mdash;she wouldn't really. But it was always the way when a plain
      practical woman married on the quality. Imperence and dis-respeck&mdash;that's
      the capers! Imperence and disrespeck from the ones that's doing nothing
      and behoulden to you for everything. It was shocking! It was disthressing!
    </p>
    <p>
      In such outbursts would her jealousy taunt him with his poverty, revile
      him for his idleness, and square accounts with him for the manifest
      preference of the boy. He could bear them with patience when they were
      alone, but in Philip's presence they were as gall and wormwood, and whips
      and scorpions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, my lad, go,&rdquo; he would sometimes whimper, and hustle the boy out of
      the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; the woman would cry, &ldquo;stop and see the man your father is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the father would mutter, &ldquo;He might see the woman his mother is as
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when she had pinned them together, and the boy had to hear her out,
      the man would drop his forehead on the table and break into groans and
      tears. Then the woman would change quite suddenly, and put her arms about
      him and kiss him and weep over him. He could defend himself from neither
      her insults nor her embraces. In spite of everything he loved her. That
      was where the bitterness of the evil lay. But for the love he bore her, he
      might have got her off his back and been his own man once more. He would
      make peace with her and kiss her again, and they would both kiss the boy,
      and be tender, and even cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was still a child, but he saw the relations of his parents, and in
      his own way he understood everything. He loved his father best, but he did
      not hate his mother. She was nearly always affectionate, though often
      jealous of the father's greater love and care for him, and sometimes
      irritable from that cause alone. But the frequent broils between them were
      like blows that left scars on his body. He slept in a cot in the same
      room, and he would cover up his head in the bedclothes at night with a
      feeling of fear and physical pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man cannot fight against himself for long. That deadly enemy is certain
      to slay. When Philip was six years old his father lay sick of his last
      sickness. The wife had fallen into habits of intemperance by this time,
      and stage by stage she had descended to the condition of an utterly
      degraded woman. There was something to excuse her. She had been
      disappointed in the great stakes of life; she had earned disgrace where
      she had looked for admiration. She was vain, and could not bear
      misfortune; and she had no deep well of love from which to drink when the
      fount of her pride ran dry. If her husband had indulged her with a little
      pity, everything might have gone along more easily. But he had only loved
      her and been ashamed. And now that he lay near to his death, the love
      began to ebb and the shame to deepen into dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slept little at night, and as often as he closed his eyes certain
      voices of mocking and reproach seemed to be constantly humming in his
      ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your son!&rdquo; they would cry. &ldquo;What is to become of him? Your dreams! Your
      great dreams! Deemster! Ballawhaine! God knows what! You are leaving the
      boy; who is to bring him up? His mother? Think of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last a ray of pale sunshine broke on the sleepless wrestler with the
      night, and he became almost happy. &ldquo;I'll speak to the boy,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I
      will tell him my own history, concealing nothing. Yes, I will tell him of
      my own father also, God rest him, the stern old man&mdash;severe, yet
      just.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An opportunity soon befell. It was late at night&mdash;very late. The
      woman was sleeping off a bout of intemperance somewhere below; and the
      boy, with the innocence and ignorance of his years in all that the solemn
      time foreboded, was bustling about the room with mighty eagerness, because
      he knew that he ought to be in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm staying up to intend on you, father,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father answered with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you asturb yourself, father. I'll intend on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father's sigh deepened to a moan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want anything 'aticular, just call me; d'ye see, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And away went the boy like a gleam of light. Presently he came back,
      leaping like the dawn. He was carrying, insecurely, a jug of poppy-head
      and camomile, which had been prescribed as a lotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poppy heads, father! Poppy-heads is good, I can tell ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why arn't you in bed, child?&rdquo; said the father. &ldquo;You must be tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm not tired, father. I was just feeling a bit of tired, and then I
      took a smell of poppy-heads and away went the tiredness to Jericho. They
      <i>is</i> good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little white head was glinting off again when the father called it
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, my boy.&rdquo; The child went up to the bedside, and the father ran
      his fingers lovingly through the long fair hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think, Philip, that twenty, thirty, forty years hence, when you
      are a man&mdash;aye, a big man, little one&mdash;do you think you will
      remember what I shall say to you now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, father, if it's anything 'aticular, and if it isn't you can
      amind me of it, can't you, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father shook his head. &ldquo;I shall not be here then, my boy. I am going
      away&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going away, father? May I come too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I wish you could, little one. Yes, truly I almost wish you could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you'll let me go with you, father! Oh, I <i>am</i> glad, father.&rdquo;
       And the boy began to caper and dance, to go down on all fours, and leap
      about the floor like a frog.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father fell back on his pillow with a heaving breast. Vain! vain! What
      was the use of speaking? The child's outlook was life; his own was death;
      they had no common ground; they spoke different tongues. And, after all,
      how could he suffer the sweet innocence of the child's soul to look down
      into the stained and scarred chamber of his ruined heart?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't understand me, Philip. I mean that I am going&mdash;to die.
      Yes, darling, and, only that I am leaving you behind, I should be glad to
      go. My life has been wasted, Philip. In the time to come, when men speak
      of your father, you will be ashamed. Perhaps you will not remember then
      that whatever he was he was a good father to you, for at least he loved
      you dearly. Well, I must needs bow to the will of God, but if I could only
      hope that you would live to restore my name when I am gone.... Philip, are
      you&mdash;don't cry, my darling. There, there, kiss me. We'll say no more
      about it then. Perhaps it's not true, although father tolded you? Well,
      perhaps not. And now undress and slip into bed before mother comes. See,
      there's your night-dress at the foot of the crib. Wants some buttons, does
      it? Never mind&mdash;in with you&mdash;that's a boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Impossible, impossible! And perhaps unnecessary. Who should say? Young as
      the child was, he might never forget what he had seen and heard. Some day
      it must have its meaning for him. Thus the father comforted himself. Those
      jangling quarrels which had often scorched his brain like iron&mdash;the
      memory of their abject scenes came to him then, with a sort of bleeding
      solace!
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, with little catching sobs, which he struggled to repress, the
      boy lay down in his crib. When half-way gone towards the mists of the land
      of sleep, he started up suddenly, and called &ldquo;Good night, father,&rdquo; and his
      father answered him &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Towards three o'clock the next morning there was great commotion in the
      house. The servant was scurrying up and downstairs, and the mistress,
      wringing her hands, was tramping to and fro in the sick-room, crying in a
      tone of astonishment, as if the thought had stolen upon her unawares,
      &ldquo;Why, he's going! How didn't somebody tell me before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the sinking man were on the crib. &ldquo;Philip,&rdquo; he faltered. They
      lifted the boy out of his bed, and brought him in his night-dress to his
      father's side; and the father twisted about and took him into his arms,
      still half asleep and yawning. Then the mother, recovering from the
      stupidity of her surprise, broke into paroxysms of weeping, and fell over
      her husband's breast and kissed and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For once her kisses had no response. The man was dying miserably, for he
      was thinking of her and of the boy. Sometimes he babbled over Philip in a
      soft, inarticulate gurgle; sometimes he looked up at his wife's face with
      a stony stare, and then he clung the closer to the boy, as if he would
      never let him go. The dark hour came, and still he held the boy in his
      arms. They had to release the child at last from his father's dying grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dead of the night was gone by this time, and the day was at the point
      of dawn; the sparrows in the eaves were twittering, and the tide, which
      was at its lowest ebb, was heaving on the sand far out in the bay with the
      sound as of a rookery awakening. Philip remembered afterwards that his
      mother cried so much that he was afraid, and that when he had been dressed
      she took him downstairs, where they all ate breakfast together, with the
      sun shining through the blinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother did not live to overshadow her son's life. Sinking yet lower in
      habits of intemperance, she stayed indoors from week-end to week-end,
      seated herself like a weeping willow by the fireside, and drank and drank.
      Her excesses led to delusions. She saw ghosts perpetually. To avoid such
      of them as haunted the death-room of her husband, she had a bed made up on
      a couch in the parlour, and one morning she was found face downwards
      stretched out beside it on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Philip's father's cousin, always called his Aunty Nan, came to
      Ballure House to bring him up. His father had been her favourite cousin,
      and, in spite of all that had happened, he had been her lifelong hero
      also. A deep and secret tenderness, too timid to be quite aware of itself,
      had been lying in ambush in her heart through all the years of his
      miserable life with Mona. At the death of the old Deemster, her other
      cousin, Peter, had married and cast her off. But she was always one of
      those woodland herbs which are said to give out their sweetest fragrance
      after they have been trodden on and crushed. Philip's father had been her
      hero, her lost one and her love, and Philip was his father's son.

    <h2>
      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Little curly Pete, with the broad, bare feet, the tousled black head, the
      jacket half way up his back like a waistcoat with sleeves, and the hole in
      his trousers where the tail of his shirt should have been, was Peter
      Quilliam, and he was the natural son of Peter Christian. In the days when
      that punctilious worthy set himself to observe the doings of his elder
      brother at Ballure, he found it convenient to make an outwork of the hedge
      in front of the thatched house that stood nearest. Two persons lived in
      the cottage, father and daughter&mdash;Tom Quilliam, usually called Black
      Tom, and Bridget Quilliam, getting the name of Bridget Black Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was a short, gross creature, with an enormous head and a big, open
      mouth, showing broken teeth that were black with the juice of tobacco. The
      girl was by common judgment and report a gawk&mdash;a great, slow-eyed,
      comely-looking, comfortable, easy-going gawk. Black Tom was a thatcher,
      and with his hair poking its way through the holes in his straw hat, he
      tramped the island in pursuit of his calling. This kept him from home for
      days together, and in that fact Peter Christian, while shadowing the
      morality of his brother, found his own opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the child was born, neither the thatcher nor his daughter attempted
      to father it. Peter Christian paid twenty pounds to the one and eighty to
      the other in Manx pound-notes, the boys daubed their door to show that the
      house was dishonoured, and that was the end of everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl went through her &ldquo;censures&rdquo; silently, or with only one comment.
      She had borrowed the sheet in which she appeared in church from Miss
      Christian of Ballawhaine, and when she took it back, the good soul of the
      sweet lady thought to improve the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was wondering, Bridget,&rdquo; she said gravely, &ldquo;what you were thinking of
      when you stood with Bella and Liza before the congregation last Sunday
      morning&rdquo;&mdash;two other Magda-lenes had done penance by Bridget's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Deed, mistress,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;I was thinkin' there wasn't a sheet at
      one of them to match mine for whiteness. I'd 'a been ashamed to be seen in
      the like of theirs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bridget may have been a gawk, but she did two things which were not
      gawkish. Putting the eighty greasy notes into the foot of an old stocking,
      she sewed them up in the ticking of her bed, and then christened her baby
      Peter. The money was for the child if she should not live to rear him, and
      the name was her way of saying that a man's son was his son in spite of
      law or devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that she kept both herself and her child by day labour in the
      fields, weeding and sowing potatoes, and following at the tail of the
      reapers, for sixpence a day dry days, and fourpence all weathers. She
      might have badgered the heir of Ballawhaine, but she never did so. That
      person came into his inheritance, got himself elected member for Ramsey in
      the House of Keys, married Nessy Taubman, daughter of the rich brewer, and
      became the father of another son. Such were the doings in the big house
      down in the valley, while up in the thatched cottage behind the
      water-trough, on potatoes and herrings and barley bonnag, lived Bridget
      and her little Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete's earliest recollections were of a boy who lived at the beautiful
      white house with the big fuchsia, by the turn of the road over the bridge
      that crossed the glen. This was Philip Christian, half a year older than
      himself, although several inches shorter, with long yellow hair and rosy
      cheeks, and dressed in a velvet suit of knickerbockers. Pete worshipped
      him in his simple way, hung about him, fetched and carried for him, and
      looked up to him as a marvel of wisdom and goodness and pluck.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first memory of Philip was of sleeping with him, snuggled up by his
      side in the dark, hushed and still in a narrow bed with iron ends to it,
      and of leaping up in the morning and laughing. Philip's father&mdash;a
      tall, white gentleman, who never laughed at all, and only smiled sometimes&mdash;had
      found him in the road in the evening waiting for his mother to come home
      from the fields, that he might light the fire in the cottage, and running
      about in the meantime to keep himself warm, and not too hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      His second memory was of Philip guiding him round the drawing-room (over
      thick carpets, on which his bare feet made no noise), and showing him the
      pictures on the walls, and telling him what they meant. One (an engraving
      of St. John, with a death's-head and a crucifix) was, according to this
      grim and veracious guide, a picture of a brigand who killed his victims,
      and always skinned their skulls with a cross-handled dagger. After that
      his memories of Philip and himself were as two gleams of sunshine which
      mingle and become one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was a great reader of noble histories. He found them, frayed and
      tattered, at the bottom of a trunk that had tin corners and two padlocks,
      and stood in the room looking towards the harbour where his mother's
      father, the old sailor, had slept. One of them was his special favourite,
      and he used to read it aloud to Pete. It told of the doings of the
      Carrasdhoo men. They were a bold band of desperadoes, the terror of all
      the island. Sometimes they worked in the fields at ploughing, and reaping,
      and stacking, the same as common practical men; and sometimes they lived
      in houses, just like the house by the water-trough. But when the wind was
      rising in the nor-nor-west, and there was a taste of the brine on your
      lips, they would be up, and say, &ldquo;The sea's calling us&mdash;we must be
      going.&rdquo; Then they would live in rocky caves of the coast where nobody
      could reach them, and there would be fires lit at night in tar-barrels,
      and shouting, and singing, and carousing; and after that there would be
      ships' rudders, and figure heads, and masts coming up with the tide, and
      sometimes dead bodies on the beach of sailors they had drowned&mdash;only
      foreign ones though&mdash;hundreds and tons of them. But that was long
      ago, the Carrasdhoo men were dead, and the glory of their day was
      departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One quiet evening, after an awesome reading of this brave history, Philip,
      sitting on his haunches at the gable, with Pete like another white frog
      beside him, said quite suddenly, &ldquo;Hush! What's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was never a sound in the air above the rustle of a leaf, and Pete's
      imagination could carry him no further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete,&rdquo; said Philip, with awful gravity, &ldquo;the sea's calling me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And me,&rdquo; said Pete solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early that night the two lads were down at the most desolate part of Port
      Mooar, in a cave under the scraggy black rocks of Gobny-Garvain, kindling
      a fire of gorse and turf inside the remains of a broken barrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See that tremendous sharp rock below low water?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't I, though?&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was never a rock the size of a currycomb between them and the line
      of the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what we call a reef,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;Wait a bit and you'll see the
      ships go splitting on top of it like&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a tay-pot,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll save the women, though,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;Shall we save the women,
      Pete? We always do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, yes, the women&mdash;and the boys,&rdquo; said Pete thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip had his doubts about the boys, but he would not quarrel. It was
      nearly dark, and growing very cold. The lads croodled down by the
      crackling blaze, and tried to forget that they had forgotten tea-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never has to mind a bit of hungry,&rdquo; said Philip stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never a ha'p'orth,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only when the job's done we have hams and flitches and things for
      supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, yes, ateing and drinking to the full.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rum, Pete, we always drinks rum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We has to,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of your tea,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coorse not, none of your ould grannie's two-penny tay,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite dark by this time, and the tide was rising rapidly. There was
      not a star in the sky, and not a light on the sea except the revolving
      light of the lightship far a Way. The boys crept closer together and began
      to think of home. Philip remembered Aunty Nan. When he had stolen away on
      hands and knees under the parlour window she had been sewing at his new
      check night-shirt. A night-shirt for a Carrasdhoo man had seemed to be
      ridiculous then; but where was Aunty Nannie now? Pete remembered his
      mother&mdash;she would be racing round the houses and crying; and he had
      visions of Black Tom&mdash;he would be racing round also and swearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shouldn't we sing something, Phil?&rdquo; said Pete, with a gurgle in his
      throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sing!&rdquo; said Philip, with as much scorn as he could summon, &ldquo;and give them
      warning we're watching for them! Well, you <i>are</i> a pretty, Mr. Pete!
      But just you wait till the ships goes wrecking on the rocks&mdash;I mean
      the reefs&mdash;and the dead men's coming up like corks&mdash;hundreds and
      ninety and dozens of them; my jove! yes, then you'll hear me singing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The darkness deepened, and the voice of the sea began to moan through the
      back of the cave, the gorse crackled no longer, and the turf burned in a
      dull red glow. Night with its awfulness had come down, and the boys were
      cut off from everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don't seem to be coming&mdash;not yet,&rdquo; said Philip, in a husky
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe it's the same as fishing,&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;sometimes you catch and
      sometimes you don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it,&rdquo; said Philip eagerly, &ldquo;generally you don't&mdash;and then you
      both haves to go home and come again,&rdquo; he added nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither of the boys stirred. Outside the glow of the fire the
      blackness looked terrible. Pete nuzzled up to Philip's side, and, being
      untroubled by imaginative fears, soon began to feel drowsy. The sound of
      his measured breathing startled Philip with the terror of loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honour bright, Mr. Pete,&rdquo; he faltered, nudging the head on his shoulder,
      and trying to keep his voice from shaking; &ldquo;<i>you</i> call yourself a
      second mate, and leaving all the work to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The second mate was penitent, but in less than half a minute more he was
      committing the same offence again. &ldquo;It isn't no use,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'm that
      sleepy you never seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let's both take the watch below i'stead,&rdquo; said Philip, and they
      proceeded to stretch themselves out by the fire together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just lave it to me,&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;I'll hear them if they come in the
      night. I'll always does. I'm sleeping that light it's shocking. Why,
      sometimes I hear Black Tom when he comes home tipsy. I've done it times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have carpets to lie on to-morrow, not stones,&rdquo; said Philip,
      wriggling on a rough one; &ldquo;rolls of carpets&mdash;kidaminstrel ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They settled themselves side by side as close to each other as they could
      creep, and tried not to hear the surging and sighing of the sea. Then came
      a tremulous whimper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you never say your prayers when you take the watch below?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes we does, when mother isn't too tired, and the ould man's
      middling drunk and quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don't you like to then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, yes, though, I'm liking it scandalous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wreckers agreed to say their prayers, and got up again and said them,
      knee to knee, with their two little faces to the fire, and then stretched
      themselves out afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete, where's your hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are, Phil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In another minute, under the solemn darkness of the night, broken only by
      the smouldering fire, amid the thunderous quake of the cavern after every
      beat of the waves on the beach, the Carrasdhoo men were asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometime in the dark reaches before the dawn Pete leapt up with a start
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; he cried, in a voice of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Philip was still in the mists of sleep, and, feeling the cold, he only
      whimpered, &ldquo;Cover me up, Pete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phil!&rdquo; cried Pete, in an affrighted whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cover me up,&rdquo; drawled Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was Black Tom,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some confused bellowing outside the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My goodness grayshers!&rdquo; came in a terrible voice, &ldquo;it's them, though, the
      pair of them! Impozzible! who says it's impozzible? It's themselves I'm
      telling you, ma'm. Guy heng! The woman's mad, putting a scream out of
      herself like yonder. Safe? Coorse they're safe, bad luck to the young
      wastrels! You're for putting up a prayer for your own one. Eh? Well, I'm
      for hommering mine. The dirts? Weaned only yesterday, and fetching a
      dacent man out of his bed to find them. A fire at them, too! Well, it was
      the fire that found them. Pull the boat up, boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was half awake by this time. &ldquo;They've come,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;The
      ships is come, they're on the reef. Oh, dear me! Best go and meet them.
      P'raps they won't kill us if&mdash;if we&mdash;Oh, dear me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the wreckers, hand in hand, quaking and whimpering, stepped out to
      the mouth of the cave. At the next moment Philip found himself snatched up
      into the arms of Aunty Nan, who kissed him and cried over him, and rammed
      a great chunk of sweet cake into his cheek. Pete was faring differently.
      Under the leathern belt of Black Tom, who was thrashing him for both of
      them, he was howling like the sea in a storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the Carrasdhoo men came home by the light of early morning&mdash;Pete
      skipping before the belt and bellowing; and Philip holding a piece of the
      cake at his teeth to comfort him.

    <h2>
      IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Philip left home for school at King William's by Castletown, and then Pete
      had a hard upbringing. His mother was tender enough, and there were good
      souls like Aunty Nan to show pity to both of them. But life went like a
      springless bogey, nevertheless. Sin itself is often easier than simpleness
      to pardon and condone. It takes a soft heart to feel tenderly towards a
      soft head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Pete's head seemed soft enough and to spare. No power and no
      persuasion could teach him to read and write. He went to school at the old
      schoolhouse by the church in Maughold village. The schoolmaster was a
      little man called John Thomas Corlett, pert and proud, with the sharp nose
      of a pike and the gait of a bantam. John Thomas was also a tailor. On a
      cowhouse door laid across two school forms he sat cross-legged among his
      cloth, his &ldquo;maidens,&rdquo; and his smoothing irons, with his boys and girls,
      class by class, in a big half circle round about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great little man had one standing ground of daily assault on the dusty
      jacket of poor Pete, and that was that the lad came late to school. Every
      morning Pete's welcome from the tailor-schoolmaster was a volley of
      expletives, and a swipe of the cane across his shoulders. &ldquo;The craythur!
      The dunce! The durt! I'm taiching him, and taiching him, and he won't be
      taicht.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soul of the schoolmaster had just two human weaknesses. One of these
      was a weakness for drink, and as a little vessel he could not take much
      without being full. Then he always taught the Church catechism and swore
      at his boys in Manx.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter Quilliam,&rdquo; he cried one day, &ldquo;who brought you out of the land of
      Egypt and the house of bondage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Deed, master,&rdquo; said Pete, &ldquo;I never was in no such places, for I never
      had the money nor the clothes for it, and that's how stories are getting
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The second of the schoolmaster's frailties was love of his daughter, a
      child of four, a cripple, whom he had lamed in her infancy, by letting her
      fall as he tossed her in his arms while in drink. The constant terror of
      his mind was lest some further accident should befall her. Between class
      and class he would go to a window, from which, when he had thrown up its
      lower sash, dim with the scratches of names, he could see one end of his
      own white cottage, and the little pathway, between lines of gilvers,
      coming down from the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete had seen the little one hobbling along this path on her lame leg, and
      giggling with a heart of glee when she had eluded the eyes of her mother
      and escaped into the road. One day it chanced, after the heavy spring
      rains had swollen every watercourse, that he came upon the little curly
      poll, tumbling and tossing like a bell-buoy in a gale, down the flood of
      the river that runs to the sea at Port Mooar. Pete rescued the child and
      took her home, and then, as if he had done nothing unusual, he went on to
      school, dripping water from his legs at every step.
    </p>
    <p>
      When John Thomas saw him coming, in bare feet, triddle-traddle,
      triddle-traddle, up the school-house floor, his indignation at the boy for
      being later than usual rose to fiery wrath for being drenched as well.
      Waiting for no explanation, concluding that Pete had been fishing for
      crabs among the stones of Port Lewaigue, he burst into a loud volley of
      his accustomed expletives, and timed and punctuated them by a thwack of
      the cane between every word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The waistrel! (thwack). The dirt! (thwack). I'm taiching him (thwack),
      and taiching him (thwack), and he won't be taicht!&rdquo; (Thwack, thwack,
      thwack.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete said never a word. Boiling his stinging shoulders under his jacket,
      and ramming his smarting hands, like wet eels, into his breeches' pockets,
      he took his place in silence at the bottom of the class.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a girl, a little dark thing in a red frock, stepped out from her place
      beside the boy, shot up like a gleam to the schoolmaster as he returned to
      his seat among the cloth and needles, dealt him a smart slap across the
      face, and then burst into a lit of hysterical crying. Her name was
      Katherine Cregeen. She was the daughter of Cæsar the Cornaa miller, the
      founder of Ballajora Chapel, and a mighty man among the Methodists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katherine went unpunished, but that was the end of Pete's schooling. His
      learning was not too heavy for a big lad's head to carry&mdash;a bit of
      reading if it was all in print, and no writing at all except half-a-dozen
      capital letters. It was not a formidable equipment for the battle of life,
      but Bridget would not hear of more.
    </p>
    <p>
      She herself, meanwhile, had annexed that character which was always the
      first and easiest to attach itself to a woman with a child but no visible
      father for it&mdash;the character of a witch. That name for his mother was
      Pete's earliest recollection of the high-road, and when the consciousness
      of its meaning came to him, he did not rebel, but sullenly acquiesced, for
      he had been born to it and knew nothing to the contrary. If the boys
      quarrelled with him at play, the first word was &ldquo;your mother's a butch.&rdquo;
       Then he cried at the reproach, or perhaps fought like a vengeance at the
      insult, but he never dreamt of disbelieving the fact or of loving his
      mother any the less.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridget was accused of the evil eye. Cattle sickened in the fields, and
      when there was no proof that she had looked over the gate, the idea was
      suggested that she crossed them as a hare. One day a neighbour's dog
      started a hare in a meadow where some cows were grazing. This was observed
      by a gang of boys playing at hockey in the road. Instantly there was a
      shout and a whoop, and the boys with their sticks were in full chase after
      the yelping dog, crying, &ldquo;The butch! The butch! It's Bridget Tom!
      Corlett's dogs are hunting Bridget Black Tom! Kill her, Laddie! Kill her,
      Sailor! Jump, dog, jump!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of the boys playing at hockey was Pete. When his play-fellows ran
      after the dogs in their fanatic thirst, he ran too, but with a storm of
      other feelings. Outstripping all of them, very close at the heels of the
      dogs, kicking some, striking others with the hockey-stick, while the tears
      poured down his cheeks, he cried at the top of his voice to the hare
      leaping in front, &ldquo;Run, mammy, run! clink (dodge), mammy, clink! Aw,
      mammy, mammy, run faster, run for your life, run!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hare dodged aside, shot into a thicket, and escaped its pursuers just
      as Corlett, the farmer, who had heard the outcry, came racing up with a
      gun. Then Pete swept his coat-sleeve across his gleaming eyes and leapt
      off home. When he got there, he found his mother sitting on the bink by
      the door knitting quietly. He threw himself into her arms and stroked her
      cheek with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mammy, bogh,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;how well you run! If you never run in your
      life you run then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the boy mad?&rdquo; said Bridget.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Pete went on stroking her cheek and crying between sobs of joy, &ldquo;I
      heard Corlett shouting to the house for a gun and a fourpenny bit, and I
      thought I was never going to see mammy no more. But you did clink, mammy!
      You did, though!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next time Katherine Cregeen saw Peter Quilliam, he was sitting on the
      ridge of rock at the mouth of Ballure Glen, playing doleful strains on a
      home-made whistle, and looking the picture of desolation and despair. His
      mother was lying near to death. He had left Mrs. Cregeen, Kath-erine's
      mother, a good soul getting the name of Grannie, to watch and tend her
      while he came out to comfort his simple heart in this lone spot between
      the land and the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katherine's eyes filled at sight of him, and when, without looking up or
      speaking, he went on to play his crazy tunes, something took the girl by
      the throat and she broke down utterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Pete. No&mdash;I don't mean that&mdash;but don't cry, Pete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete was not crying at all, but only playing away on his whistle and
      gazing out to sea with a look of dumb vacancy. Katherine knelt beside him,
      put her arms around his neck, and cried for both of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody hailed him from the hedge by the water-trough, and he rose, took
      off his cap, smoothed his hair with his hand, and walked towards the house
      without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridget was dying of pleurisy, brought on by a long day's work at hoeing
      turnips in a soaking rain. Dr. Mylechreest had poulticed her lungs with
      mustard and linseed, but all to no purpose. &ldquo;It's feeling the same as the
      sun on your back at harvest,&rdquo; she murmured, yet the poultices brought no
      heat to her frozen chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar Cregeen was at her side; John the Clerk, too, called John the Widow;
      Kelly, the rural postman, who went by the name of Kelly the Thief; as well
      as Black Tom, her father. Cæsar was discoursing of sinners and their
      latter end. John was remembering how at his election to the clerkship he
      had rashly promised to bury the poor for nothing; Kelly was thinking he
      would be the first to carry the news to Christian Balla-whaine; and Black
      Tom was varying the exercise of pounding rock-sugar for his bees with that
      of breaking his playful wit on the dying woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use; I'm laving you; I'm going on my long journey,&rdquo; said Bridget,
      while Granny used a shovel as a fan to relieve her gusty breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got anything in your pocket for the road, woman?&rdquo; said the thatcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not houses of bricks and mortal I'm for calling at now,&rdquo; she
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear heart! Put up a bit of a prayer,&rdquo; whispered Grannie to her husband;
      and Cæsar took a pinch of snuff out of his waistcoat pocket, and fell to
      &ldquo;wrastling with the Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bridget seemed to be comforted. &ldquo;I see the jasper gates,&rdquo; she panted,
      fixing her hazy eyes on the scraas under the thatch, from which broken
      spiders' webs hung down like rats' tails.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she called for Pete. She had something to give him. It was the
      stocking foot with the eighty greasy Manx banknotes which his father,
      Peter Christian, had paid her fifteen years before. Pete lit the candle
      and steadied it while Grannie cut the stocking from the wall side of the
      bed-ticking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Tom dropped the sugar-pounder and exposed his broken teeth in his
      surprise at so much wealth; John the Widow blinked; and Kelly the Thief
      poked his head forward until the peak of his postman's cap fell on to the
      bridge of his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sea-fog lay over the land that morning, and when it lifted Bridget's
      soul went up as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing! Poor thing!&rdquo; said Grannie. &ldquo;The ways were cold for her&mdash;cold,
      cold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dacent lass,&rdquo; said John the Clerk; &ldquo;and oughtn't to be buried with the
      common trash, seeing she's left money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hard-working woman, too, and on her feet for ever; but 'lowanced in her
      intellecks, for all,&rdquo; said Kelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Cæsar cried, &ldquo;A brand plucked from the burning! Lord, give me more of
      the like at the judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When all was over, and tears both hot and cold were wiped away&mdash;Pete
      shed none of them&mdash;the neighbours who had stood with the lad in the
      churchyard on Maughold Head returned to the cottage by the water-trough to
      decide what was to be done with his eighty good bank-notes. &ldquo;It's a
      fortune,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;Let him put it with Mr. Dumbell,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;Get
      the boy a trade first&mdash;he's a big lump now, sixteen for spring,&rdquo; said
      a third. &ldquo;A draper, eh?&rdquo; said a fourth. &ldquo;May I presume? My nephew, Bobbie
      Clucas, of Ramsey, now?&rdquo; &ldquo;A dacent man, very,&rdquo; said John the Widow; &ldquo;but
      if I'm not ambitious, there's my son-in-law, John Cowley. The lad's cut to
      a dot for a grocer, and what more nicer than having your own shop and your
      own name over the door, if you plaze&mdash;' Peter Quilliam, tay and sugar
      merchant!'&mdash;they're telling me John will be riding in his carriage
      and pair soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chut! your grannie and your carriage and pairs,&rdquo; shouted a rasping voice
      at last. It was Black Tom. &ldquo;Who says the fortune is belonging to the lad
      at all? It's mine, and if there's law in the land I'll have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Pete, with the dull thud in his ears of earth falling on a
      coffin, had made his way down to Ballawhaine. He had never been there
      before, and he felt confused, but he did not tremble. Half-way up the
      carriage-drive he passed a sandy-haired youth of his own age, a slim dandy
      who hummed a tune and looked at him carelessly over his shoulder. Pete
      knew him&mdash;he was Boss, the boys called him Dross, son and heir of
      Christian Ballawhaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the big house Pete asked for the master. The English footman, in
      scarlet knee-breeches, left him to wait in the stone hall. The place was
      very quiet and rather cold, but all as clean as a gull's wing. There was a
      dark table in the middle and a high-backed chair against the wall. Two oil
      pictures faced each other from opposite sides. One was of an old man
      without a beard, but with a high forehead, framed around with short grey
      hair. The other was of a woman with a tired look and a baby on her lap.
      Under this there was a little black picture that seemed to Pete to be the
      likeness of a fancy tombstone. And the print on it, so far as Pete could
      spell it out, was that of a tombstone too, &ldquo;In loving memory of Verbena,
      beloved wife of Peter Chr&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Ballawhaine came crunching the sand on the hall-floor. He looked old,
      and had now a pent-house of bristly eyebrows of a different colour from
      his hair. Pete had often seen him on the road riding by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my lad, what can I do for <i>you?</i>&rdquo; he said. He spoke in a jerky
      voice, as if he thought to overawe the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete fumbled his stocking cap. &ldquo;Mothers dead,&rdquo; he answered vacantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ballawhaine knew that already. Kelly the Thief had run hot-foot to
      inform him. He thought Pete had come to claim maintenance now that his
      mother was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she's been telling you the same old story?&rdquo; he said briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that Pete's face stiffened all at once. &ldquo;She's been telling me that
      you're my father, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Ballawhaine tried to laugh. &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;it's a wise child,
      now, that knows its own father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not rightly knowing what you mane, sir,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Ballawhaine fell to slandering the poor woman in her grave,
      declaring that she could not know who was the father of her child, and
      protesting that no son of hers should ever see the colour of money of his.
      Saying this with a snarl, he brought down his right hand with a thump on
      to the table. There was a big hairy mole near the joint of the first
      finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aisy, sir, if you plaze,&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;she was telling me you gave her
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned up the corner of his jersey, tugged out of his pocket, from
      behind his flaps, the eighty Manx bank-notes, and held them in his right
      hand on the table. There was a mole at the joint of Pete's first finger
      also.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ballawhaine saw it. He drew back his hand and slid it behind him. Then
      in another voice he said, &ldquo;Well, my lad, isn't it enough? What are you
      wanting with more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not wanting more,&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;I'm not wanting this. Take it back,&rdquo;
       and he put down the roll of notes between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ballawhaine sank into the chair, took a handkerchief out of his tails
      with the hand that had been lurking there, and began to mop his forehead.
      &ldquo;Eh? How? What d'ye mean, boy?&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mane,&rdquo; said Pete, &ldquo;that if I kept that money there is people would say
      my mother was a bad woman, and you bought her and paid her&mdash;I'm
      hearing the like at some of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a step nearer. &ldquo;And I mane, too, that you did wrong by my mother
      long ago, and now that she's dead you're blackening her; and you're a bad
      heart, and a low tongue, and if I was only a man, and didn't <i>know</i>
      you were my father, I'd break every bone in your skin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Pete twisted about and shouted into the dark part of the hall, &ldquo;Come
      along, there, my ould cockatoo! It's time to be putting me to the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The English footman in the scarlet breeches had been peeping from under
      the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was Pete's first and last interview with his father. Peter Christian
      Ballawhaine was a terror in the Keys by this time, but he had trembled
      before his son like a whipped cur.

    <h2>
      V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Katherine Cregeen, Pete's champion at school, had been his companion at
      home as well. She was two years younger than Pete. Her hair was a black as
      a gipsy's, and her face as brown as a berry. In summer she liked best to
      wear a red frock without sleeves, no boots and no stockings, no collar and
      no bonnet, not even a sun-bonnet. From constant exposure to the sun and
      rain her arms and legs were as ruddy as her cheeks, and covered with a
      soft silken down. So often did you see her teeth that you would have said
      she was always laughing. Her laugh was a little saucy trill given out with
      head aside and eyes aslant, like that of a squirrel when he is at a safe
      height above your head, and has a nut in his open jaws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete had seen her first at school, and there he had tried to draw the eyes
      of the maiden upon himself by methods known only to heroes, to savages,
      and to boys. He had prowled around her in the playground with the wild
      vigour of a young colt, tossing his head, swinging his arms, screwing his
      body, kicking up his legs, walking on his hands, lunging out at every lad
      that was twice as big as himself, and then bringing himself down at length
      with a whoop and a crash on his hindmost parts just in front of where she
      stood. For these tremendous efforts to show what a fellow he could be if
      he tried, he had won no applause from the boys, and Katherine herself had
      given no sign, though Pete had watched her out of the corners of his eyes.
      But in other scenes the children came together.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Philip had gone to King William's, Pete and Katherine had become
      bosom friends. Instead of going home after school to cool his heels in the
      road until his mother came from the fields, he found it neighbourly to go
      up to Ballajora and round by the network of paths to Cornaa. That was a
      long detour, but Cæsar's mill stood there. It nestled down in the low bed
      of the river that runs through the glen called Ballaglass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Song-birds built about it in the spring of the year, and Cæsar's little
      human songster sang there always.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Pete went that way home, what times the girl had of it! Wading up the
      river, clambering over the stones, playing female Blondin on the fallen
      tree-trunks that spanned the chasm, slipping, falling, holding on any way
      up (legs or arms) by the rotten branches below, then calling for Pete's
      help in a voice between a laugh and a cry, flinging chips into the foaming
      back-wash of the mill-wheel, and chasing them down stream, racing among
      the gorse, and then lying full length like a lamb, without a thought of
      shame, while Pete took the thorns out of her bleeding feet. She was a wild
      duck in the glen where she lived, and Pete was a great lumbering tame duck
      waddling behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the glorious, happy, make-believe days too soon came to an end. The
      swinging cane of the great John Thomas Corlett, and the rod of a yet more
      relentless tyrant, darkened the sunshine of both the children. Pete was
      banished from school, and Catherine's father removed from Cornaa.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Cæsar had taken a wife, he had married Betsy, the daughter of the
      owner of the inn at Sulby. After that he had &ldquo;got religion,&rdquo; and he held
      that persons in the household of faith were not to drink, or to buy or to
      sell drink. But Grannie's father died and left his house, &ldquo;The Manx
      Fairy,&rdquo; and his farm, Glenmooar, to her and her husband. About the same
      time the miller at Sulby also died, and the best mill in the island cried
      out for a tenant. Cæsar took the mill and the farm, and Grannie took the
      inn, being brought up to such profanities and no way bound by principle.
      From that time forward, Cæsar pinned all envious cavillers with the text
      which says, &ldquo;Not that which goeth into the mouth of a man defileth him,
      but that which cometh out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Cæsar's principles grew more and more puritanical year by
      year. There were no half measures with Cæsar. Either a man was a saved
      soul, or he was in the very belly of hell, though the pit might not have
      shut its mouth on him. If a man was saved he knew it, and if he felt the
      manifestations of the Spirit he could live without sin. His cardinal
      principles were three&mdash;instantaneous regeneration, assurance, and
      sinless perfection. He always said&mdash;he had said it a thousand times&mdash;that
      he was converted in Douglas marketplace, a piece off the west door of ould
      St. Matthew's, at five-and-twenty minutes past six on a Sabbath evening in
      July, when he was two-and-twenty for harvest.
    </p>
    <p>
      While at Cornaa, Cæsar had been a &ldquo;local&rdquo; on the preachers' plan, a class
      leader, and a chapel steward; but at Sulby he outgrew the Union and set up
      a &ldquo;body&rdquo; of his own. He called them &ldquo;The Christians.&rdquo; a title that was at
      once a name, a challenge, and a protest. They worshipped in the long barn
      over Cæsar's mill, and held strong views on conduct. A saved soul must not
      wear gold or costly apparel, or give way to softness or bodily indulgence,
      or go to fairs for sake of sport, or appear in the show-tents of
      play-actors, or sing songs, or read books, or take any diversion that did
      not tend to the knowledge of God. As for carnal transgression, if any were
      guilty of it, they were to be cut off from the body of believers, for the
      souls of the righteous must be delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The religion that's going among the Primitives these days is just
      Popery,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;Let's go back to the warm ould Methodism and put out
      the Romans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Pete turned his face from Ballawhaine, he thought first of Cæsar and
      his mill. It would be more exact to say he thought of Katherine and
      Grannie. He was homeless as well as penniless. The cottage by the
      water-trough was no longer possible to him, now that the mother was gone
      who had stood between his threatened shoulders and Black Tom. Philip was
      at home for a few weeks only in the year, and Ballure had lost its
      attraction. So Pete made his way to Sulby, offered himself to Cæsar for
      service at the mill, and was taken on straightway at eighteenpence a week
      and his board.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a curious household he entered into. First there was Cæsar himself,
      in a moleskin waistcoat with sleeves open three buttons up, knee-breeches
      usually unlaced, stockings of undyed wool, and slippers with the tongues
      hanging out&mdash;a grim soul, with whiskers like a hoop about his face,
      and a shaven upper lip as heavy as a moustache, for, when religion like
      Cæsar's lays hold of a man, it takes him first by the mouth. Then Grannie,
      a comfortable body in a cap, with an outlook on life that was all
      motherhood, a simple, tender, peaceable soul, agreeing with everybody and
      everything, and seeming to say nothing but &ldquo;Poor thing! Poor thing!&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Dear heart! Dear heart!&rdquo; Then there was Nancy Cain, getting the name of
      Nancy Joe, the servant in name but the mistress in fact, a niece of
      Grannie's, a bit of a Pagan, an early riser, a tireless worker, with a
      plain face, a rooted disbelief in all men, a good heart, an ugly tongue,
      and a vixenish temper. Last of all, there was Katherine, now grown to be a
      great girl, with her gipsy hair done up in a red ribbon and wearing a
      black pinafore bordered with white braid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete got on steadily at the mill. He began by lighting the kiln fire and
      cleaning out the pit-wheel, and then on to the opening the flood-gates in
      the morning and regulating the action of the water-wheel according to the
      work of the day. In two years' time he was a sound miller, safe to trust
      with rough stuff for cattle or fine flour for white loaf-bread. Cæsar
      trusted him. He would take evangelising journeys to Peel or Douglas and
      leave Pete in charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      That led to the end of the beginning. Pete could grind the farmers' corn,
      but he could not make their reckonings. He kept his counts in chalk on the
      back of the mill-house door, a down line for every stone weight up to
      eight stones, and a line across for every hundredweight. Then, once a day,
      while the father was abroad, Katherine came over from the inn to the desk
      at the little window of the mill, and turned Pete's lines into ledger
      accounts. These financial councils were full of delicious discomfiture.
      Pete always enjoyed them&mdash;after they were over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Robert&mdash;Molleycarane&mdash;did you say Molleycarane, Pete? Oh,
      Mylecharane&mdash;Myle-c-h-a-r-a-i-n-e, Molleycarane; ten stones&mdash;did
      you say ten? Oh, eight&mdash;e-i-g-h-t&mdash;no, eight; oatmeal, Pete? Oh,
      barley-male&mdash;meal, I mean&mdash;m-e-a-l.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the night Pete remembered all these entries. They were
      very precious to his memory after Katherine had spoken them. They sang in
      his heart the same as song-birds then. They were like hymns and tunes and
      pieces of poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar returned home from a preaching tour with a great and sudden thought.
      He had been calling on strangers to flee from the wrath to come, and yet
      there were those of his own house whose faces were not turned Zionwards.
      That evening he held an all-night prayer-meeting for the conversion of
      Katherine and Pete. Through six long hours he called on God in lusty
      tones, until his throat cracked and his forehead streamed. The young were
      thoughtless, they had the root of evil in them, they flew into frivolity
      from contrariness. Draw the harrow over their souls, plough the fallows of
      their hearts, grind the chaff out of their household, let not the sweet
      apple and the crabs grow on the same bough together, give them a Melliah,
      let not a sheaf be forgotten, grant them the soul of this girl for a
      harvest-home, and of this boy for a last stook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar was dissatisfied with the results. He was used to groaning and
      trembling and fainting fits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you feel the love?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I do&mdash;here, under the
      watch-pocket of my waistcoat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Towards midnight Katherine began to fail. &ldquo;Chain the devil,&rdquo;, cried Cæsar.
      &ldquo;Once I was down in the pit with the devil myself, but now I'm up in the
      loft, seeing angels through the thatch. Can't you feel the workings of the
      Spirit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the clock was warning to strike two Katherine thought she could, and
      from that day forward she led the singing of the women in the choir among
      &ldquo;The Christians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete remained among the unregenerate; but nevertheless &ldquo;The Christians&rdquo;
       saw him constantly. He sat on the back form and kept his eyes fixed on the
      &ldquo;singing seat.&rdquo; Observing his regularity, Cæsar laid a hand on his head
      and told him the Spirit was working in his soul at last. Sometimes Pete
      thought it was, and that was when he shut his eyes and listened to
      Katherine's voice floating up, up, up, like an angel's, into the sky. But
      sometimes he knew it was not; and that was when he caught himself in the
      middle of Cæsar's mightiest prayers crooking his neck past the pitching
      bald pate of Johnny Niplightly, the constable, that he might get a glimpse
      of the top of Katherine's bonnet when her eyes were down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete fell into a melancholy, and once more took to music as a comforter.
      It was not a home-made whistle now, but a fiddle bought out of his wages.
      On this he played in the cowhouse on winter evenings, and from the top of
      the midden outside in summer. When Cæsar heard of it his wrath was
      fearful. What was a fiddler? He was a servant of corruption, holding a
      candle to disorderly walkers and happy sinners on their way into the
      devil's pinfold. And what for was fiddles? Fiddles was for play-actors and
      theaytres. &ldquo;And theaytres is <i>there</i>,&rdquo; said Cæsar, indicating with
      his foot one flag on the kitchen-floor, &ldquo;and hell flames is <i>there</i>,&rdquo;
       he added, rolling his toe over to the joint of the next one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grannie began to plead. What was a fiddle if you played the right tunes on
      it? Didn't they read in the ould Book of King David himself playing on
      harps and timbrels and such things? And what was harps but fiddles in a
      way of spak-ing? Then warn't they all looking to be playing harps in
      heaven? 'Deed, yes, though the Lord would have to be teaching her how to
      play hers!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar was shaken. &ldquo;Well, of course, certainly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if there's a
      power in fiddling to bring souls out of bondage, and if there's going to
      be fiddling and the like in Abraham's bosom&mdash;why, then, of course&mdash;well,
      why not?&mdash;let's have the lad's fiddle up at 'The Christians.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could have suited Pete so well. From that time forward he went out
      no more at nights to the cowhouse, but stayed indoors to practise hymns
      with Katherine. Oh, the terrible rapture of those nightly &ldquo;practices!&rdquo;
       They brought people to the inn to hear them, and so Cæsar found them good
      for profit both ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in Cæsar's definition, nevertheless. It was found that
      among the saints there were certain weaker brethren who did not want a
      hymn to their ale. One of these was Johnny Niplightly, the rural
      constable, who was the complement of Katherine in the choir, being leader
      of the singing among the men. He was a tall man with a long nose, which
      seemed to have a perpetual cold. Making his rounds one night, he turned in
      at &ldquo;The Manx Fairy,&rdquo; when Cæsar and Grannie were both from home, and Nancy
      Joe was in charge, and Pete and Katherine were practising a revival
      chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Cæsar, dough?&rdquo; he snuffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Peel, buying the stock,&rdquo; snapped Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dank de Lord! I mean&mdash;where's Grannie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nursing Mistress Quiggin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Niplightly eased the strap of his beaver, liberated his lips, took a deep
      draught of ale, and then turned to Pete, with apologetic smiles, and
      suggested a change in the music.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that Katherine leapt up as light as laughter. &ldquo;A dance,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;a
      dance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good sakes alive?&rdquo; said Nancy Joe. &ldquo;Listen to the girl? Is it the moon,
      Kitty, or what is it that's doing on you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut your eyes, Nancy,&rdquo; said Katherine, &ldquo;just for once, now won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can do what you like with me, with your coaxing and woaxing,&rdquo; said
      Nancy. &ldquo;Enjoy yourself to the full, girl, but don't make a noise above the
      singing of the kettle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete tuned his strings, and Katherine pinned up the tail of her skirt, and
      threw herself into position.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of the livelier preludings there came thronging out of the
      road into the parlour certain fellows of the baser sort, and behind them
      came one who was not of that denomination&mdash;a fair young man with a
      fine face under an Alpine hat. Heeding nothing of this audience, the girl
      gave a little rakish toss of her head and called on Pete to strike up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Pete plunged into one of the profaner tunes which he had practised in
      the days of the cowhouse, and off went Katherine with a whoop. The boys
      stood back for her, bending down on their haunches as at a fight of
      gamecocks, and encouraging her with shouts of applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful! Look at that now! Fine, though, fine! Clane done, aw, clane!
      Done to a dot! There's leaping for you, boys! Guy heng, did you ever see
      the like? Hommer the floor, girl&mdash;higher a piece! higher, then!
      Whoop, did ye ever see such a nate pair of ankles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hould your dirty tongue, you gobmouthed omathaun!&rdquo; cried Nancy Joe. She
      had tried to keep her eyes away, but could not. &ldquo;My goodness grayshers!&rdquo;
       she cried. &ldquo;Did you ever see the like, though? Screwing like the windmill
      on the schoolhouse! Well, well, Kitty, woman! Aw, Kirry, Kirry! Wherever
      did she get it, then? Goodsakes, the girl's twisting herself into knots!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete was pulling away at the fiddle with both hands, like a bottom sawyer,
      his eyes dancing, his lips quivering, the whole soul of the lad lifted out
      of himself in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hould on still, Kate, hould on, girl!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Ma-chree! Machree!
      The darling's dancing like a drumstick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faster!&rdquo; cried Kate. &ldquo;Faster!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The red ribbon had fallen from her head, and the wavy black hair was
      tumbling about her face. She was holding up her skirt with one hand, and
      the other arm was akimbo at her waist. Guggling, chuckling, crowing,
      panting, boiling, and bubbling with the animal life which all her days had
      been suppressed, and famished and starved into moans and groans, she was
      carried away by her own fire, gave herself up to it, and danced on the
      flags of the kitchen which had served Cæsar for his practical typology,
      like a creature intoxicated with new breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Cæsar himself, coming home in his chapel hat (his tall black
      beaver) from Peel, where he had been buying the year's stock of herrings
      at the boat's side, had overtaken, on the road, the venerable parson of
      his parish, Parson Quiggin of Lezayre. Drawing up the gig with a &ldquo;Woa!&rdquo; he
      had invited the old clergyman to a lift by his side on the gig's seat,
      which was cushioned with a sack of hay. The parson had accepted the
      invitation, and with a preliminary &ldquo;Aisy! Your legs a taste higher, sir,
      just to keep the pickle off your trousers,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Gee up!&rdquo; and a touch of the
      whip, they were away together, with the light of the gig-lamp on the
      hind-quarters of the mare, as they bobbed and screwed like a mill-race
      under the splash-hoard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Cæsar's chance, and he took it. Having pinned one of the heads of
      the Church, he gave him his views on the Romans, and on the general
      encroachment of Popery. The parson listened complacently. He was a
      tolerant old soul, with a round face, expressive of perpetual happiness,
      though he was always blinking his little eyes and declaring, with the
      Preacher, that all earthly things were vain. Hence he was nicknamed Old
      Vanity of Vanities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gig had swept past Sulby Chapel when Cæsar began to ask for the
      parson's opinion of certain texts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may I presume, Pazon Quiggin, what d'ye think of the text&mdash;'Praise
      the Lord. O my soul, and all that is within me praise His Holy Name?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very good text after meat, Mr. Cregeen,&rdquo; said the parson, blinking his
      little eyes in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Cæsar's favourite text, and his fire was kindled at the parson's
      praise. &ldquo;Man alive,&rdquo; he cried, his hot breath tickling the parson's neck,
      &ldquo;I've praiched on that text, pazon, till it's wet me through to the
      waistcoat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were near to &ldquo;The Manx Fairy&rdquo; by this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And talking of praise,&rdquo; said Cæsar, &ldquo;I hear them there at their
      practices. Asking pardon now&mdash;it's proud I'd be, sir&mdash;perhaps
      you'd not be thinking mane to come in and hear the way we do 'Crown Him!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the saints use the fiddle,&rdquo; said the parson, as the gig drew up at the
      porch of the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a minute afterwards the door of the parlour flew open with a bang,
      and Cæsar stood and glared on the threshold with the parson's ruddy face
      behind him. There was a moment's silence. The uplifted toe of Katherine
      trailed back to the ground, the fiddle of Pete slithered to his farther
      side, and the smacking lips of Niplightly transfixed themselves agape.
      Then the voice of the parson was heard to say, &ldquo;Vanity, vanity, all is
      vanity!&rdquo; and suddenly Cæsar, still on the threshold, went down on his
      knees to pray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar's prayer was only a short one. His mortified pride called for
      quicker solace. Rising to his feet with as much dignity as he could
      command under the twinkling eyes of the parson, he stuttered, &ldquo;The capers!
      Making a dacent house into a theaytre! Respectable person, too&mdash;one
      of the first that's going! So,&rdquo; facing the spectators, &ldquo;just help
      yourselves home the pack of you! As for these ones,&rdquo; turning on Kate,
      Pete, and the constable, &ldquo;there'll be no more of your practices. I'll do
      without the music of three saints like you. In future I'll have three
      sinners to raise my singing. These polices, too!&rdquo; he said with a withering
      smile. (Niplightly was worming his way out at the back of Parson Quiggin.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who began it?&rdquo; shouted Cæsar, looking at Katherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment that Cæsar dropped on his knees at the door, Pete had been
      well-nigh choked by an impulse to laugh aloud. But now he bit his lip and
      said, &ldquo;I did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behould ye now, as imperent as a goat!&rdquo; said Cæsar, working his eyebrows
      vigorously. &ldquo;You've mistaken your profession, boy. It's a play-actorer
      they ought to be making of you. You're wasting your time with a plain,
      respectable man like me. You must lave me. Away to the loft for your
      chiss, boy! And just give sheet, my lad, and don't lay to till you've
      fetched up at another lodgings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete, with his eye on the parson's face, could control himself no longer,
      and he laughed so loud that the room rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right's the word, ould Nebucannezzar,&rdquo; he cried, and heaved up to his
      feet. &ldquo;So long, Kitty, woman! S'long! We'll finish it another night
      though, and then the ould man himself will be houlding the candle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Outside in the road somebody touched him on the shoulder. It was the young
      man in the Alpine hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gough! What? Phil!&rdquo; cried Pete, and he laid hold of him with both
      hands at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've just finished at King William's and bought a boat,&rdquo; said Philip,
      &ldquo;and I came up to ask you to join me&mdash;congers and cods, you know&mdash;good
      fun anyway. Are you willing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willing!&rdquo; cried Pete. &ldquo;Am I jumping for joy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And away they went down the road, swinging their legs together with a
      lively step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a nice girl, though&mdash;Kitty, Kate, what do you call her?&rdquo; said
      Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you in then? So you saw her dancing?&rdquo; said Pete eagerly. &ldquo;Aw, yes,
      nice,&rdquo; he said warmly, &ldquo;nice uncommon,&rdquo; he added absently, and then with a
      touch of sadness, &ldquo;shocking nice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently they heard the pattering of light feet in the darkness behind
      them, and a voice like a broken cry calling &ldquo;Pete!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Kate. She came up panting and catching her breath in hiccoughs,
      took Pete's face in both her hands, drew it down to her own face, kissed
      it on the mouth, and was gone again without a word.

      Philip had not been a success at school; he had narrowly escaped being a
      failure. During his earlier years he had shown industry without gifts;
      during his later years he had shown gifts without industry. His childish
      saying became his by-word, and half in sport, half in earnest, with a
      smile on his lips, and a shuddering sense of fascination, he would say
      when the wind freshened, &ldquo;The sea's calling me, I must be off.&rdquo; The blood
      of the old sea-dog, his mother's father, was strong in him. Idleness led
      to disaster, and disaster to some disgrace. He was indifferent to both
      while at school, but shame found him out at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be sixteen for spring,&rdquo; said Auntie Nan, &ldquo;and what would your poor
      father say if he were alive? He thought worlds of his boy, and always said
      what a man he would be some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the shaft that found Philip. The one passion that burned in his
      heart like a fire was reverence for the name and the will of his dead
      father. The big hopes of the broken man had sometimes come as a torture to
      the boy when the blood of the old salt was rioting within him. But now
      they came as a spur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip went back to school and worked like a slave. There were only three
      terms left, and it was too late for high honours, but the boy did wonders.
      He came out well, and the masters were astonished. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; they said,
      &ldquo;there's no denying it, the boy Christian must have the gift of genius.
      There's nothing he might not do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Phil had much of the blood of Captain Billy, Pete had much of the blood
      of Black Tom. After leaving the mill at Sulby, Pete made his home in the
      cabin of the smack. What he was to eat, and how he was to be clothed, and
      where he was to be lodged when the cold nights came, never troubled his
      mind for an instant. He had fine times with his partner. The terms of
      their partnership were simple. Phil took the fun and made Pete take the
      fish. They were a pair of happy-go-lucky lads, and they looked to the
      future with cheerful faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one shadow over their content, and that was the ghost of a gleam
      of sunshine. It made daylight between them, though, day by day as they ran
      together like two that run a race. The prize was Katherine Cregeen. Pete
      talked of her till Phil's heart awoke and trembled; but Phil hardly knew
      it was so, and Pete never once suspected it. Neither confessed to the
      other, and the shifts of both to hide the secret of each were boyish and
      beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a river famous for trout that rises in Sulby glen and flows into
      Ramsey harbour. One of the little attempts of the two lads to deceive each
      other was to make believe that it was their duty to fish this river with
      the rod, and so wander away singly up the banks of the stream until they
      came to &ldquo;The Manx Fairy,&rdquo; and then drop in casually to quench the thirst
      of so much angling. Towards the dusk of evening Philip, in a tall silk hat
      over a jacket and knickerbockers, would come upon Pete by the Sulby
      bridge, washed, combed, and in a collar. Then there would be looks of
      great surprise on both sides. &ldquo;What, Phil! Is it yourself, though? Just
      thought I'd see if the trouts were biting to-night. Dear me, this is Sulby
      too! And bless my soul, 'The Fairy' again I Well, a drop of drink will do
      no harm. Shall we put a sight on them inside, eh?&rdquo; After that prelude they
      would go into the house together.
    </p>
    <p>
      This little comedy was acted every night for weeks. It was acted on
      Hollantide Eve six months after Pete had been turned out by Cæsar. Grannie
      was sitting by the glass partition, knitting at intervals, serving at the
      counter occasionally and scoring up on a black board that was a mass of
      chalk hieroglyphics. Cæsar himself in ponderous spectacles and with a big
      book in his hands was sitting in the kitchen behind with his back to the
      glass, so as to make the lamp of the business serve also for his studies.
      On a bench in the bar sat Black Tom, smoking, spitting, scraping his feet
      on the sanded floor, and looking like a gigantic spider with enormous bald
      head. At his side was a thin man with a face pitted by smallpox, and a
      forehead covered with strange protuberances. This was Jonaique Jelly,
      barber, clock-mender, and Manx patriot. The postman was there, too, Kelly
      the Thief, a tiny creature with twinkling ferret eyes, and a face that had
      a settled look of age, as of one born old, being wrinkled in squares like
      the pointing of a cobble wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of Pete, Grannie made way, and he pushed through to the kitchen,
      where he seated himself in a seat in the fireplace just in front of the
      peat closet, and under the fish hanging to smoke. At sight of Phil she
      dropped her needles, smoothed her front hair, rose in spite of protest,
      and wiped down a chair by the ingle. Cæsar eyed Pete in silence from
      between the top rim of his spectacles and the bottom edge of the big book;
      but as Philip entered he lowered the book and welcomed him. Nancy Joe was
      coming and going in her clogs like a rip-rap let loose between the dairy
      and a pot of potatoes in their jackets which swung from the slowrie, the
      hook over the fire. A moment later Kate came flitting through the half-lit
      kitchen, her black eyes dancing and her mouth rippling in smiles. She
      courtesied to Philip, grimaced at Pete, and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then from the other side of the glass partition came the husky voice of
      the postman, saying, &ldquo;Well, I must be taking the road, gentlemen. There's
      Manx ones starting for Kim-berley by the early sailing to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then came the voice of the barber in a hoarse falsetto: &ldquo;Kimberley!
      That's the place for good men I'm always saying. There's Billy the Red
      back home with a fortune. And ould Corlett&mdash;look at ould Corlett, the
      Ballabeg! Five years away at the diggings, and left a house worth twenty
      pounds per year per annum, not to spake of other hereditaments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that the rasping voice of Black Tom, in a tone of irony and
      contempt: &ldquo;Of coorse, aw, yes, of coorse, there's goold on the cushags
      there, they're telling me. But I thought you were a man that's all for the
      island, Mr. Jelly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lave me alone for that,&rdquo; said the voice of the barber. &ldquo;Manx-land for the
      Manx-man&mdash;that's the text I'm houlding to. But what's it saying,
      'Custom must be indulged with custom, or custom will die?' And with these
      English scouring over it like puffins on the Calf, it isn't much that's
      left of the ould island but the name. The best of the Manx boys are going
      away foreign, same as these ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've letters for them to the packet-office anyway,&rdquo; said the
      postman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are they, Mr. Kelly?&rdquo; called Philip, through the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of the Quarks ones from Glen Rushen, sir, and the Gills boys from
      Castletown over. Good-night all, goodnight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door closed behind the postman, and Black Tom growled, &ldquo;Slips of lads&mdash;I
      know them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smart though, smart uncommon,&rdquo; said the barber; &ldquo;that's the only sort
      they're wanting out yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a contemptuous snort. &ldquo;So? You'd better go to Kimberley
      yourself, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn the clock back a piece and I'll start before you've time to curl
      your hair,&rdquo; said the barber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Tom was lifting his pot. &ldquo;That's the one thing,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the
      Almighty Himself&rdquo; (gulp, gulp) &ldquo;can't do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which?&rdquo; tittered the barber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both,&rdquo; said Black Tom, scratching his big head, as bald as a bladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar flashed about with his face to the glass partition. &ldquo;You're like the
      rest of the infidels, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;only spaking to contradick yourself&mdash;calling
      God the Almighty, and telling in the same breath of something He can't
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile an encounter of another sort was going on at the ingle. Kate had
      re-appeared with a table fork which she used at intervals to test the
      boiling of the potatoes. At each approach to the fire she passed close to
      where Pete sat, never looking at Phil above the level of his boots. And as
      often as she bent over the pot, Pete put his arm round her waist, being so
      near and so tempting. For thus pestering her she beat her foot like a
      goat, and screwed on a look of anger which broke down in a stifled laugh;
      but she always took care to come again to Pete's side rather than to
      Phil's, until at last the nudging and shoving ended in a pinch and a
      little squeal, and a quick cry of &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; from Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate vanished like a flash, the dim room began to frown again, and Phil to
      draw his breath heavily, when the girl came back as suddenly bringing an
      apple and a length of string. Mounting a chair, she fixed one end of the
      string to the lath of the ceiling by the peck, the parchment oatcake pan,
      and the other end she tied to the stalk of the apple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the jeel now?&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy! Don't you know? Not heard f'Hop-tu-naa'? It's Hollantide Eve,
      man,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then setting the string going like a pendulum, she stood back a pace with
      hands clasped behind her, and snapped at the apple as it swung, sometimes
      catching it, sometimes missing it, sometimes marking it, sometimes biting
      it, her body bending and rising with its waggle, and nod, and bob, her
      mouth opening and closing, her white teeth gleaming, and her whole face
      bubbling over with delight. At every touch the speed increased, and the
      laughter grew louder as the apple went faster. Everybody, except the
      miller, joined in the fun. Phil cried out on the girl to look to her
      teeth, but Pete egged her on to test the strength of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snap at it, Kitty!&rdquo; cried Pete. &ldquo;Aw, lost! Lost again! Ow! One in the
      cheek! No matter! Done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Black Tom and Mr. Jelly stood up to watch through the doorway. &ldquo;My
      goodness grayshers!&rdquo; cried one. &ldquo;What a mouthful!&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Share
      it, Kitty, woman; aw, share and share alike, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But then came the thunderous tones of Cæsar. &ldquo;Drop it, drop it! Such
      practices is nothing but Popery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Popery!&rdquo; cried Black Tom from over the counter. &ldquo;Chut! nonsense, man! The
      like of it was going before St. Patrick was born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate was puffing and panting and taking down the pendulum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it mean then, Tom?&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it's you for knowing things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mane? It manes fairies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fairies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Black Tom sat down with a complacent air, and his rasping voice came from
      the other side of the glass. &ldquo;In the ould times gone by, girl, before
      Manxmen got too big for their breeches, they'd be off to bed by ten
      o'clock on Hollantide Eve to lave room for the little people that's
      outside to come in. And the big woman of the house would be filling the
      crocks for the fairies to drink, and the big man himself would be raking
      the ashes so they might bake their cakes, and a girl, same as you, would
      be going to bed backwards&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know! I know!&rdquo; cried Kate, near to the ceiling, and clapping her hands.
      &ldquo;She eats a roasted apple, and goes to bed thirsty, and then dreams that
      somebody brings her a drink of water, and that's the one that's to be her
      husband, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got it, girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar had been listening with his eyes turned sideways off his book, and
      now he cried, &ldquo;Then drop it, I'm telling you. It's nothing but instruments
      of Satan, and the ones that's telling it are just flying in the face of
      faith from superstition and contrariety. It isn't dacent in a Christian
      public-house, and I'm for having no more of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grannie paused in her knitting, fixed her cap with one of her needles and
      said, &ldquo;Dear heart, father! Tom meant no harm.&rdquo; Then, glancing at the clock
      and rising, &ldquo;But it's time to shut up the house, anyway. Good night, Tom!
      Good night all! Good night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil and Pete rose also. Pete went to the door and pretended to look out,
      then came back to Kate's side and whispered, &ldquo;Come, give them the slip&mdash;there's
      somebody outside that's waiting for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them wait,&rdquo; said the girl, but she laughed, and Pete knew she would
      come. Then he turned to Philip, &ldquo;A word in your ear, Phil,&rdquo; he said, and
      took him by the arm and drew him out of the house and round to the yard of
      the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good night, Grannie,&rdquo; said Mr. Jelly, going out behind them. &ldquo;But
      if I were as young as your grandson there, Mr. Quilliam, I would be making
      a start for somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandson!&rdquo; grunted Tom, heaving up, &ldquo;I've got no grandson, or he wouldn't
      be laving me to smoke a dry pipe. But he's making an Almighty of this Phil
      Christian&mdash;that's it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After they were gone, Grannie began counting the till and saying, &ldquo;As for
      fairies&mdash;one, two, three&mdash;it may be, as Cæsar says&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;the
      like isn't in, but it's safer to be civil to them anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, yes,&rdquo; said Nancy Joe, &ldquo;a crock of fresh water and a few good words
      going to bed on Hollantide Eve does no harm at all, at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Outside in the stable-yard the feet of Black Tom and Jonaique Jelly were
      heard going off on the road. The late moon was hanging low, red as an
      evening sun, over the hill to the south-east. Pete was puffing and blowing
      as if he had been running a race. &ldquo;Quick, boy, quick!&rdquo; he was whispering,
      &ldquo;Kate's coming. A word in your ear first. Will you do me a turn, Phil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spake to the ould man for me while I spake to the girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Pete could hear, nothing except his own voice. &ldquo;The ould angel
      herself, she's all right, but the ould man's hard. Spake for me, Phil;
      you've got the fine English tongue at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what about?&rdquo; Philip said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say I may be a bit of a rip, but I'm not such a bad sort anyway. Make me
      out a taste, Phil, and praise me up. Say I'll be as good as goold; yes,
      will I though. Tell him he has only to say yes, and I'll be that studdy
      and willing and hardworking and persevering you never seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Pete, Pete, Pete, whatever am I to say all this about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete's puffing and panting ceased. &ldquo;What about? Why, about the girl for
      sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girl!&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else?&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate? Am I to speak for you to the father for Kate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip's voice seemed to come up from the bottom depths of his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you thinking hard of the job, Phil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's silence. The blood had rushed to Philip's face, which
      was full of strange matter, but the darkness concealed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't say that,&rdquo; he faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete mistook Philip's hesitation for a silent commentary on his own
      unworthiness. &ldquo;I know I'm only a sort of a waistrel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but, Phil,
      the way I'm loving that girl it's shocking. I can never take rest for
      thinking of her. No, I'm not sleeping at night nor working reg'lar in the
      day neither. Everything is telling of her, and everything is shouting her
      name. It's 'Kate' in the sea, and 'Kate' in the river, and the trees and
      the gorse. 'Kate,' 'Kate,' 'Kate,' it's Kate constant, and I can't stand
      much more of it. I'm loving the girl scandalous, that's the truth, Phil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete paused, but Philip gave no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's hard to praise me, that's sarten sure,&rdquo; said Pete, &ldquo;but I've known
      her since she was a little small thing in pinafores, and I was a slip of a
      big boy, and went into trousers, and we played Blondin in the glen
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Philip did not speak. He was gripping the stable-wall with his
      trembling fingers, and struggling for composure. Pete scraped the
      paving-stones at his feet, and mumbled again in a voice that was near to
      breaking. &ldquo;Spake for me, Phil. It's you to do it. You've the way of saying
      things, and making them out to look something. It would be clane ruined in
      a jiffy if I did it for myself. Spake for me, boy, now won't you, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Philip was silent. He was doing his best to swallow a lump in his
      throat. His heart had begun to know itself. In the light of Pete's
      confession he had read his own secret. To give the girl up was one thing;
      it was another to plead for her for Pete. But Pete's trouble touched him.
      The lump at his throat went down, and the fingers on the wall slacked
      away. &ldquo;I'll do it,&rdquo; he said, only his voice was like a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he tried to go off hastily that he might hide the emotion that came
      over him like a flood that had broken its dam. But Pete gripped him by the
      shoulder, and peered into his face in the dark. &ldquo;You will, though,&rdquo; said
      Pete, with a little shout of joy; &ldquo;then it's as good as done; God bless
      you, old fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip began to roll about. &ldquo;Tut, it's nothing,&rdquo; he said, with a stout
      heart, and then he laughed a laugh with a cry in it. He could have said no
      more without breaking down; but just then a flash of light fell on them
      from the house, and a hushed voice cried, &ldquo;Pete!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's herself,&rdquo; whispered Pete. &ldquo;She's coming! She's here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip turned, and saw Kate in the doorway of the dairy, the sweet young
      figure framed like a silhouette by the light behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going!&rdquo; said Philip, and he edged up to the house as the girl stepped
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete followed him a step or two in approaching Kate. &ldquo;Whist, man!&rdquo; he
      whispered. &ldquo;Tell the old geezer I'll be going to chapel reglar early tides
      and late shifts, and Sunday-school constant. And, whist! tell him I'm
      larning myself to play on the harmonia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Philip slithered softly through the dairy door, and shut it after
      him, leaving Kate and Pete together.

      VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The kitchen of &ldquo;The Manx Fairy&rdquo; was now savoury with the odour of herrings
      roasting in their own brine, and musical with the crackling and frizzling
      of the oil as it dropped into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a long way back to Ballure, Mrs. Cregeen,&rdquo; said Philip, popping his
      head in at the door jamb. &ldquo;May I stay to a bite of supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, stay and welcome,&rdquo; said Cæsar, putting down the big book, and Nancy
      Joe said the same, dropping her high-pitched voice perceptibly, and
      Grannie said, also, &ldquo;Right welcome, sir, if you'll not be thinking mane to
      take pot luck with us. Potatoes and herrings, Mr. Christian; just a
      Manxman's supper. Lift the pot off the slowrie, Nancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and isn't he a Manxman himself, mother?&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am, Mr. Cregeen,&rdquo; said Philip, laughing noisily. &ldquo;If I'm not,
      who should be, eh?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Manxman or no Manxman, what for should he turn up his nose at
      herrings same as these?&rdquo; said Nancy Joe. She was dishing up a bowlful.
      &ldquo;Where'll he get the like of them? Not in England over, I'll go bail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, no, Nancy,&rdquo; said Philip, still laughing needlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if they had them there, the poor, useless creatures would be lost to
      cook them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Deed, would they, Nancy,&rdquo; said Grannie. She was rolling the potatoes
      into a heap on to the bare table. &ldquo;And we've much to be thankful for, with
      potatoes and herrings three times a day; but we shouldn't be thinking
      proud of our-selves for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask the gentleman to draw up, mother,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draw up, sir, draw up. Here's your bowl of butter-milk. A knife and fork,
      Nancy. We're no people for knife and fork to a herring, sir. And a plate
      for Mr. Christian, woman; a gentleman usually likes a plate. Now ate, sir,
      ate and welcome&mdash;but where's your friend, though?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete! oh! he's not far off.&rdquo; Saying this, Philip interrupted his laughter
      to distribute sage winks between Nancy Joe and Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar looked around with a potato half peeled in his fingers. &ldquo;And the
      girl&mdash;where's Kate?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's not far off neither,&rdquo; said Philip, still winking vigorously. &ldquo;But
      don't trouble about them, Mr. Cregeen. They'll want no supper. They're
      feeding on sweeter things than herrings even.&rdquo; Saying this he swallowed a
      gulp with another laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar lifted his head with a pinch of his herring between finger and thumb
      half way to his open mouth. &ldquo;Were you spaking, sir?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that Philip laughed immoderately. It was a relief to drown with
      laughter the riot going on within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, dear, what's agate of the boy?&rdquo; thought Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a dog bite that's working on him?&rdquo; thought Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking!&rdquo; cried Philip, &ldquo;of course I'm speaking. I've come in to do it,
      Mr. Cregeen&mdash;I've come in to speak for Pete. He's fond of your
      daughter, Cæsar, and wants your good-will to marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord-a-massy!&rdquo; cried Nancy Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear heart alive!&rdquo; muttered Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter Quilliam!&rdquo; said Cæsar, &ldquo;did you say Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, Mr. Cregeen, Peter Quilliam,&rdquo; said Philip stoutly, &ldquo;my friend
      Pete, a rough fellow, perhaps, and without much education, but the
      best-hearted lad in the island. Come now, Cæsar, say the word, sir, and
      make the young people happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He almost foundered over that last word, but Cæsar kept him up with a
      searching look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I picked him out of the streets, as you might say,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you did, Mr. Cregeen, so you did. I always thought you were a
      discerning man, Cæsar. What do you say, Grannie? It's Cæsar for knowing a
      deserving lad when he sees one, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave another round of his cunning winks, and Grannie replied, &ldquo;Aw,
      well, it's nothing against either of them anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar was gitting as straight as a crowbar and as grim as a gannet. &ldquo;And
      when he left me, he gave me imperence and disrespeck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the lad meant no harm, father,&rdquo; said Grannie; &ldquo;and hadn't you told
      him to take to the road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let every bird hatch its own eggs, mother; it'll become you better,&rdquo; said
      Cæsar. &ldquo;Yes, sir, the lip of Satan and the imperence of sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete!&rdquo; cried Philip, in a tone of incredulity; &ldquo;why, he hasn't a thought
      about you that isn't out of the Prayer-book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar snorted. &ldquo;No? Then maybe that's where he's going for his curses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No curses at all,&rdquo; said Nancy Joe, from the side of the table, &ldquo;but a
      right good lad though, and you've never had another that's been a patch on
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar screwed round to her and said severely, &ldquo;Where there's geese there's
      dirt, and where there's women there's talking.&rdquo; Then turning back to
      Philip, he said in a tone of mock deference, &ldquo;And may I presume, sir&mdash;a
      little question&mdash;being a thing like that's general understood&mdash;what's
      his fortune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip fell back in his chair. &ldquo;Fortune? Well, I didn't think that you now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;We're not children of Israel in the wilderness getting
      manna dropped from heaven twice a day. If it's only potatoes and herrings
      itself, we're wanting it three times, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Do what he would to crush it, Philip could not help feeling a sense of
      relief. Fate was interfering; the girl was not for Pete. For the first
      moment since he returned to the kitchen he breathed freely and fully. But
      then came the prick of conscience: he had come to plead for Pete, and he
      must be loyal; he must not yield; he must exhaust all his resources of
      argument and persuasion. The wild idea occurred to him to take Cæsar by
      force of the Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But think what the old book says, Mr. Cregeen, 'take no thought for the
      morrow'&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what Johnny Niplightly said, Mr. Christian, when he lit my kiln
      overnight and burnt my oats before morning.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But consider the lilies'&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have considered them, sir; but I'm foiling still and mother has to
      spin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And isn't Pete able to toil, too,&rdquo; said Philip boldly. &ldquo;Nobody better in
      the island; there's not a lazy bone in his body, and he'll earn his living
      anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>is</i> his living, sir?&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip halted for an answer, and then said, &ldquo;Well, he's only with me in
      the boat at present, Mr. Cregeen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what's he getting? His meat and drink and a bit of pence, eh? And
      you'll be selling up some day, it's like, and going away to England over,
      and then where is he? Let the girl marry a mother-naked man at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you're wanting help yourself, father,&rdquo; said Grannie. &ldquo;Yes, you are
      though, and time for chapel too and aisément in your old days&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give the lad my mill as well as my daughter, is that it, eh?&rdquo; said Cæsar.
      &ldquo;No, I'm not such a goose as yonder, either. I could get heirs, sir,
      heirs, bless ye&mdash;fifty acres and better, not to spake of the bas'es.
      But I can do without them. The Lord's blest me with enough. I'm not for
      daubing grease on the tail of the fat pig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so, Cæsar,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;just so; you can afford to take a poor man
      for your son-in-law, and there's Pete&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd be badly in want of a bird, though, to give a groat for an owl,&rdquo; said
      Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lad means well, anyway,&rdquo; said Grannie; &ldquo;and he was that good to his
      mother, poor thing&mdash;it was wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew the woman,&rdquo; said Cæsar; &ldquo;I broke a sod of her grave myself. A
      brand plucked from the burning, but not a straight walker in this life.
      And what is the lad himself? A monument of sin without a name. A bastard,
      what else? And that's not the port I'm sailing for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down to this point Philip had been torn by conflicting feelings. He was no
      match for Cæsar in worldly logic, or at fencing with texts of Scripture.
      The devil had been whispering at his ear, &ldquo;Let it alone, you'd better.&rdquo;
       But his time had come at length to conquer both himself and Cæsar. Rising
      to his feet at Cæsar's last word, he cried in a voice of wrath, &ldquo;What? You
      call yourself a Christian man, and punish the child for the sin of the
      parent! No name, indeed! Let me tell you, Mr. Cæsar Cregeen, it's possible
      to have one name in heaven that's worse than none at all on earth, and
      that's the name of a hypocrite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying he threw back his chair, and was making for the door, when Cæsar
      rose and said softly, &ldquo;Come into the bar and have something.&rdquo; Then,
      looking back at Philip's plate, he forced a laugh, and said, &ldquo;But you've
      turned over your herring, sir&mdash;that's bad luck.&rdquo; And, putting a hand
      on Philip's shoulder, he added, in a lower tone, &ldquo;No disrespeck to you,
      sir; and no harm to the lad, but take my word for it, Mr. Christian, if
      there's an amble in the mare it'll be in the colt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip went off without another word. The moon was rising and whitening as
      he stepped from the door. Outside the porch a figure flitted past him in
      the uncertain shadows with a merry trill of mischievous laughter. He found
      Pete in the road, puffing and blowing as before, but from a different
      cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The living devil's in the girl for sartin,&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;I can't get my
      answer out of her either way.&rdquo; He had been chasing her for his answer, and
      she had escaped him through a gate. &ldquo;But what luck with the ould man,
      Phil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Phil told him of the failure of his mission&mdash;told him plainly
      and fully but tenderly, softening the hard sayings but revealing the whole
      truth. As he did so he was conscious that he was not feeling like one who
      brings bad news. He knew that his mouth in the darkness was screwed up
      into an ugly smile, and, do what he would; he could not make it straight
      and sorrowful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The happy laughter died off Pete's, lips, and he listened at first in
      silence, and afterwards with low growls. When Phil showed him how his
      poverty was his calamity he said, &ldquo;Ay, ay, I'm only a wooden-spoon man.&rdquo;
       When Phil told him how Cæsar had ripped up their old dead quarrel he
      muttered, &ldquo;I'm on the ebby tide, Phil, that's it.&rdquo; And when Phil hinted at
      what Cæsar had said of his mother and of the impediment of his own birth,
      a growl came up from the very depths of him, and he scraped the stones
      under his feet and said, &ldquo;He shall repent it yet; yes, shall he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, don't take it so much to heart&mdash;it's miserable to bring you
      such bad news,&rdquo; said Phil; but he knew the sickly smile was on his lips
      still, and he hated himself for the sound of his own voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete found no hollow ring in it. &ldquo;God bless you, Phil,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you've
      done the best for me, I know that. My pocket's as low as my heart, and it
      isn't fair to the girl, or I shouldn't be asking the ould man's lave
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood a moment in silence, crunching the wooden laths of the garden
      fence like matchwood in his fingers, and then said, with sudden
      resolution, &ldquo;I know what I'll do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; said Philip.. &ldquo;I'll go abroad; I'll go to Kimberley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, will I though, and quick too. You heard what the men were saying in
      the evening&mdash;there's Manx ones going by the boat in the morning?
      Well, I'll go with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you talk of being low in your pocket,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;Why, it will take
      all you've got, man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And more, too,&rdquo; said Pete, &ldquo;but you'll lend me the lave of the
      passage-money. That's getting into debt, but no matter. When a man falls
      into the water he needn't mind the rain. I'll make good money out yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A light had appeared at the window of an upper room, and Pete shook his
      clenched fist at it and cried, &ldquo;Good-bye, Master Cregeen. I'll put worlds
      between us. You were my master once, but nobody made you my master for
      ever&mdash;neither you nor no man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this time Philip knew that hell was in his heart. The hand that had
      let him loose when his anger got the better of him with Cæsar was
      clutching at him again. Some evil voice at his ear was whispering, &ldquo;Let
      him go; lend him the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Pete,&rdquo; he faltered, &ldquo;and don't talk nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Pete heard nothing. He had taken a few steps forward, as far as to the
      stable-yard, and was watching the light in the house. It was moving from
      window to window of the dark wall. &ldquo;She's taking the father's candle,&rdquo; he
      muttered. &ldquo;She's there,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;No, she has gone. She's coming
      back though.&rdquo; He lifted the stocking cap from his head and fumbled it in
      his hands. &ldquo;God bless her,&rdquo; he murmured. He sank to his knees on the
      ground. &ldquo;And take care of her while I'm away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moon had come up in her whiteness behind, and all was quiet and solemn
      around. Philip fell back and turned away his face.

    <h2>
      VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Cæsar came in after seeing Philip to the door, he said, &ldquo;Not a word
      of this to the girl. You that are women are like pigs&mdash;we've got to
      pull the way we don't want you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On that Kate herself came in, blushing a good deal, and fussing about with
      great vigour. &ldquo;Are you talking of the piggies, father?&rdquo; she said artfully.
      &ldquo;How tiresome they are, to be sure! They came out into the yard when the
      moon rose and I had such work to get them back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar snorted a little, and gave the signal for bed. &ldquo;Fairies indeed!&rdquo; he
      said, in a tone of vast contempt, going to the corner to wind the clock.
      &ldquo;Just wakeness of faith,&rdquo; he said over the clank of the chain as the
      weights rose; &ldquo;and no trust in God neither,&rdquo; he added, and then the clock
      struck ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grannie had lit two candles&mdash;one for herself and her husband, the
      other for Nancy Joe. Nancy had slyly filled three earthenware crocks with
      water from the well, and had set them on the table, mumbling something
      about the kettle and the morning. And Cæsar himself, pretending not to see
      anything, and muttering dark words about waste, went from the clock to the
      hearth, and raked out the hot ashes to a flat surface, on which you might
      have laid a girdle for baking cakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Nancy,&rdquo; called Grannie, from half-way up the stairs, and
      Cæsar, with his head down, followed grumbling. Nancy went off next, and
      then Kate was left alone. She had to put out the lamp and wait for her
      father's candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the lamp was gone the girl was in the dark, save for the dim light of
      the smouldering fire. She began to tremble and to laugh in a whisper. Her
      eyes danced in the red glow of the dying turf. She slipped off her shoes
      and went to a closet in the wall. There she picked an apple out of a
      barrel, and brought it to the fire and roasted it. Then, down on her knees
      before the hearth, she took took two pinches of the apple and swallowed
      them. After that and a little shudder she rose again, and turned about to
      go to bed, backwards, slowly, tremblingly, with measured steps, feeling
      her way past the furniture, having a shock when she touched anything, and
      laughing to herself, nervously, when she remembered what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door of her father's room and Grannie's she called, with a quaver
      in her voice, and a sleepy grunt came out to her. She reached one hand
      through the door, which was ajar, and took the burning candle. Then she
      blew out the light with a trembling puff, that had to be twice repeated,
      and made for her own bedroom, still going backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sweet little chamber over the dairy, smelling of new milk and
      ripe apples, and very dainty in dimity and muslin. Two tiny windows looked
      out from it, one on to the stable-yard and the other on to the orchard.
      The late moon came through the orchard window, over the heads of the dwarf
      trees, and the little white place was lit up from the floor to the sloping
      thatch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate went backwards as far as to the bed, and sat down on it She fancied
      she heard a step in the yard, but the yard window was at her back, and she
      would not look behind. She listened, but heard nothing more except a
      see-sawing noise from the stable, where the mare was running her rope in
      the manger ring. Nothing but this and the cheep-cheep of a mouse that was
      gnawing the wood somewhere in the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he come?&rdquo; she asked herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose and loosened her gown, and as it fell to her feet she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which will it be, I wonder&mdash;which?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moonlight had crept up to the foot of the bed, and now lay on it like
      a broad blue sword speckled as with rust by the patchwork counterpane.
    </p>
    <p>
      She freed her hair from its red ribbon, and it fell in a shower about her
      face. All around her seemed hushed and awful. She shuddered again, and
      with a back ward hand drew down the sheets. Then she took a long, deep
      breath, like a sigh that is half a smile, and lay down to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Somewhere towards the dawn, in the vague shadow-land between a dream and
      the awakening, Kate thought she was startled by a handful of rice thrown
      at her carriage on her marriage morning. The rattle came again, and then
      she knew it was from gravel dashed at her bedroom window. As she
      recognised the sound, a voice came as through a cavern, crying, &ldquo;Kate!&rdquo;
       She was fully awake by this time. &ldquo;Then it's to be Pete,&rdquo; she thought.
      &ldquo;It's bound to be Pete, it's like,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;It's himself
      outside, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Pete indeed. He was standing in the thin darkness under the window,
      calling the girl's name out of the back of his throat, and whistling to
      her in a sort of whisper. Presently he heard a movement inside the room,
      and he said over his shoulder, &ldquo;She's coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was the click of a latch and the slithering of a sash, and then out
      through the little dark frame came a head like a picture, with a face all
      laughter, crowned by a cataract of streaming black hair, and rounded off
      at the throat by a shadowy hint of the white frills of a night-dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate,&rdquo; said Pete again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pretended to have come to the window merely to look out, and, like a
      true woman, she made a little start at the sound of his voice, and a
      little cry of dismay at the idea that he was so close beneath and had
      taken her unawares. Then she peered down into the gloom and said, in a
      tone of wondrous surprise, &ldquo;It must be Pete, surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so it is, Kate,&rdquo; said Pete, &ldquo;and he couldn't take rest without
      spaking to you once again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, looking back and covering her eyes, and thinking of Black
      Tom and the fairies. But suddenly the mischief of her sex came dancing
      into her blood, and she could not help but plague the lad. &ldquo;Have you lost
      your way, Pete?&rdquo; she asked, with an air of innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not my way, but myself, woman,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lost yourself! Have the lad's wits gone moon-raking, I wonder? Are you
      witched then, Pete?&rdquo; she inquired, with vast solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, witched enough. Kate&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; sighed Kate. &ldquo;Did she strike you unknown and sudden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unknown it was, Kirry, and sudden, too. Listen, though&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw dear, aw dear! Was it old Mrs. Cowley of the Curragh? Did she turn
      into a hare? Is it bitten you've been, Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, yes, bitten enough. But, Kate&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was a dog, it's like. Is it flying from the water you are, Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but flying <i>to</i> the water, woman. Kate, I say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it burning they're doing for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burning and freezing both. Will you hear me, though? I'm going away&mdash;hundreds
      and thousands of miles away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then from the window came a tone of great awe, uttered with face turned
      upward as if to the last remaining star.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy! Poor boy! it's bitten he is, for sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it's yourself that's bitten me. Kirry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little crow of gaiety. &ldquo;Me? Am I the witch? You called me a
      fairy in the road this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fairy you are, girl, and a witch too; but listen, now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said I was an angel, though, at the cowhouse gable; and an angel
      doesn't bite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she barked like a dog, and laughed a shrill laugh like a witch, and
      barked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Pete could bear no more. &ldquo;Go on, then; go on with your capers! Go on!&rdquo;
       he cried, in a voice of reproach. &ldquo;It's not a heart that's at you at all,
      girl, but only a stone. You see a man going away from the island&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the island?&rdquo; Kate gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Middling down in the mouth, too, and plagued out of his life between the
      ruck of you,&rdquo; continued Pete; &ldquo;but God forgive you all, you can't help
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you say you were going out of the island, Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coorse I did; but what's the odds? Africa, Kimberley, the Lord knows
      where&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kimberley! Not Kimberley, Pete!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kimberley or Timbuctoo, what's it matter to the like of you? A man's
      coming up in the morning to bid you good-bye before an early sailing, and
      you're thinking of nothing but your capers and divilments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's you to know what a girl's thinking, isn't it, Mr. Pete? And why are
      you flying in my face for a word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flying? I'm not flying. It's driven I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Driven, Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Driven away by them that's thinking I'm not fit for you. Well, that's
      true enough, but they shan't be telling me twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They? Who are they, Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the odds? Flinging my mother at me, too&mdash;poor little mother!
      And putting the bastard on me, it's like. A respectable man's girl isn't
      going begging that she need marry a lad without a name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden ejaculation from the window-sash. &ldquo;Who dared to say
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever they are, you can tell them, if it's me they mean, that, name or
      no name, when I want to marry I'll marry the man I like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I thought that now, Kitty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for you, Mr. Pete, that's so ready with your cross words, you can go
      to your Kimberley. Yes, go, and welcome; and what's more&mdash;what's more&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the voice of anger, in the half light overhead, broke down suddenly
      into an inarticulate gurgle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what's this?&rdquo; said Pete in a flurry. &ldquo;You're not crying though,
      Kate? Whatever am I saying to you, Kitty, woman? Here, here&mdash;bash me
      on the head for a blockhead and an omathaun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Pete was clambering up the wall by the side of the dairy window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get down, then,&rdquo; whispered Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her wrath was gone in a moment, and Pete, being nearer to her now, could
      see tears of laughter dancing in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get down, Pete, or I'll shut the window, I will&mdash;yes, I will.&rdquo; And,
      to show how much she was in earnest in getting out of his reach, she shut
      up the higher sash and opened the lower one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling!&rdquo; cried Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! What's that?&rdquo; Kate whispered, and drew back on her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the door of the pig-sty open again?&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate drew a breath of relief. &ldquo;It's only somebody snoring,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ould man,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;That's all serene! A good ould sheepdog, that
      snaps more than, he bites, but he's best when he's sleeping&mdash;more
      safer, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the good of going away, Pete?&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;You'd have to make a
      fortune to satisfy father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Others have done it, Kitty&mdash;why shouldn't I? Manx ones too&mdash;silver
      kings and diamond kings, and the Lord knows what. No fear of me! When I
      come back it's a queen you'll be, woman&mdash;my queen, anyway, with pigs
      and cattle and a girl to wash and do for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that's how you'd bribe a poor girl is it? But you'd have to turn
      religious, or father would never consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I come home again, Kitty, I'll be that religious you never seen.
      I'll be just rolling in it. You'll hear me spaking like the Book of
      Genesis and Abraham, and his sons, and his cousins; I'll be coming up at
      night making love to you at the cowhouse door like the Acts of the
      Apostles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that will be some sort of courting, anyway. But who says I'll be
      wanting it? Who says I'm willing for you to go away at all with the notion
      that I must be bound to marry you when you come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Pete stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen. I'll be working like a nigger out yonder, and making my pile, and
      banking it up, and never seeing nothing but the goold and the girls&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My goodness! What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, never fear! I'm a one-woman man, Kate; but loving one is giving me
      eyes for all. And you'll be waiting for me constant, and never giving a
      skute of your little eye to them drapers and druggists from Ramsey&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one of them? Not Jamesie Corrin, even&mdash;he's a nice boy, is
      Jamesie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That dandy-divil with the collar? Hould your capers, woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor young Ballawhaine&mdash;Ross Christian, you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ross Christian be&mdash;well, no; but, honour bright, you'll be saying,
      'Peter's coming; I must be thrue!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I've got my orders, sir, eh? It's all settled then, is it? Hadn't you
      better fix the wedding-day and take out the banns, now that your hand is
      in? I have got nothing to do with it, seemingly. Nobody asks me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whist, woman!&rdquo; cried Pete. &ldquo;Don't you hear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cuckoo was passing over the house and calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's over the thatch, Kate. 'Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo!' Three times! Bravo!
      Three times is a good Amen. Omen is it? Have it as you like, love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stars had paled out by this time, and the dawn was coming up like a
      grey vapour from the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh! the air feels late; I must be going in,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a bit of a draught from the mountains&mdash;it's not morning yet,&rdquo;
       said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bird called from out of the mist somewhat far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, though. That's the throstle up the glen,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another bird answered from the eaves of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what's that?&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Was it yourself, Kitty? How straight your
      voice is like the throstle's!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hung her head at the sweet praise, but answered tartly, &ldquo;How people
      will be talking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dead white light came sweeping over the front of the house, and the
      trees and the hedges, all quiet until then, began to shudder. Kate
      shuddered too, and drew the frills closer about her throat. &ldquo;I'm going,
      Pete,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. It's only a taste of the salt from the sea,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;The
      moon's not out many minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you goose, it's been gone these two hours. This isn't Jupiter, where
      it's moonlight always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always moonlight in Jubiter, is it?&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;My goodness! What
      coorting there must be there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cock crowed from under the hen-roost, the dog barked indoors, and the
      mare began to stamp in her stall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you sail, Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First tide&mdash;seven o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time to be off, then. Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hould hard&mdash;a word first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word. I'm going back to bed. See, there's the sun coming up over
      the mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a touch of red on the tip of ould Cronky's nose. Listen! Just to
      keep them dandy-divils from plaguing you, I'll tell Phil to have an eye on
      you while I'm away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Christian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call him Philip, Kate. He's as free as free. No pride at all. Let him
      take care of you till I come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm shutting the window, Pete!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! Something else. Bend down so the ould man won't hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't reach&mdash;what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your hand, then; I'll tell it to your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated a moment, and then dropped her hand over the window-sill,
      and he clutched at it and kissed it, and pushed back the white sleeve and
      ran up the arm with his lips as far as he could climb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another, my girl; take your time, one more&mdash;half a one, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew her arm back until her hand got up to his hand, and then she
      said, &ldquo;What's this? The mole on your finger still, Pete? You called me a
      witch&mdash;now see me charm it away. Listen!&mdash;'Ping, ping, prash,
      Cur yn cadley-jiargan ass my chass.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was uttering the Manx charm in a mock-solemn ululation when a bough
      snapped in the orchard, and she cried, &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Philip. He's waiting under the apple-tree,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My goodness me!&rdquo; said Kate, and down went the window-sash.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later it rose again, and there was the beautiful young face in
      its frame as before, but with the rosy light of the dawn on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he been there all the while?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What matter? It's only Phil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye! Good luck!&rdquo; and then the window went down for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time to go,&rdquo; said Philip, still in his tall silk hat and his
      knickerbockers. He had been standing alone among the dead brown fern, the
      withering gorse, and the hanging brambles, gripping the apple-tree and
      swallowing the cry that was bubbling up to his throat, but forcing himself
      to look upon Pete's happiness, which was his own calamity, though it was
      tearing his heart out, and he could hardly bear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The birds were singing by this time, and Pete, going back, sang and
      whistled with the best of them.

    <p>
      In the mists of morning, Grannie had awakened in her bed with the turfy
      scraas of the thatch just visible above her, and the window-blind like a
      hazy moon floating on the wall at her side. And, fixing her nightcap, she
      had sighed and said, &ldquo;I can't close my eyes for dreaming that the poor lad
      has come to his end untimeously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar yawned, and asked, &ldquo;What lad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young Pete, of course,&rdquo; said Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar <i>umpht</i> and grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were poor ourselves when we began, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grannie felt the glare of the old man's eye on her in the darkness.
      &ldquo;'Deed, we were; but people forget things. We had to borrow to buy our big
      overshot wheel; we had, though. And when ould Parson Harrison sent us the
      first boll of oats, we couldn't grind it for want of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar tugged at the counterpane and said, &ldquo;Will you lie quiet, woman, and
      let a hard-working man sleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don't be the young man's destruction, Cæsar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar made a contemptuous snort, and pulled the bedclothes about his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, 'deed, father, but the girl might do worse. A fine, strapping lad.
      And, dear heart, the cheerful face <i>at</i> him! It's taking joy to look
      at&mdash;like drawing water from a well! And the laugh <i>at</i> the boy,
      too&mdash;that joyful, it's as good to hear in the morning as six pigs at
      a lit&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then marry the lad yourself, woman, and have done with it,&rdquo; cried Cæsar,
      and, so saying, he kicked out his leg, turned over to the wall, and began
      to snore with great vigour.

    <h2>
      XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The tide was up in Ramsey Harbour, and rolling heavily on the shore before
      a fresh sea-breeze with a cold taste of the salt in it. A steamer lying by
      the quay was getting up steam; trucks were running on her gangways, the
      clanking crane over her hold was working, and there was much shouting of
      name, and ordering and protesting, and general tumult. On the after-deck
      stood the emigrants for Kimberley, the Quarks from Glen Rushen, and some
      of the young Gills from Castletown&mdash;stalwart lads, bearing themselves
      bravely in the midst of a circle of their friends, who talked and laughed
      to make them forget they were on the point of going.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete and Phil came up the quay, and were received by a shout of
      incredulity from Quayle, the harbour-master. &ldquo;What, are you going, too,
      Mr. Philip?&rdquo; Philip answered him &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and passed on to the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete was still in his stocking cap and Wellington boots, but he had a
      monkey-jacket over his blue guernsey. Except for a parcel in a red print
      handkerchief, this was all his kit and luggage. He felt a little lost amid
      all the bustle, and looked helpless and unhappy. The busy preparations on
      land and shipboard had another effect on Philip. He sniffed the breeze off
      the bay and laughed, and said, &ldquo;The sea's calling me, Pete; I've half a
      mind to go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete answered with a watery smile. His high spirits were failing him at
      last. Five years were a long time to be away, if one built all one's hopes
      on coming back. So many things might happen, so many chances might befall.
      Pete had no heart for laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip had small mind for it, either, after the first rush of the salt in
      his blood was over. He felt at some moments as if hell itself were inside
      of him. What troubled him most was that he could not, for the life of him,
      be sorry that Pete was leaving the island. Once or twice since they left
      Sulby he had been startled by the thought that he hated Pete. He knew that
      his lip curled down hard at sight of Pete's solemn face. But Pete never
      suspected this, and the innocent tenderness of the rough fellow was every
      moment beating it down with blows that cut like ice and burnt like fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were standing by the forecastle head, and talking above the loud
      throbbing of the funnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Phil; you've been wonderful good to me&mdash;better nor anybody
      in the world. I've not been much of a chum for the like of you, either&mdash;you
      that's college bred and ought to be the first gentry in the island if
      everybody had his own. But you shan't be ashamed for me, neither&mdash;no
      you shan't, so help me God! I won't be long away, Phil&mdash;maybe five
      years, maybe less, and when I come back you'll be the first Manxman
      living. No? But you will, though; you will, I'm telling you. No nonsense
      at all, man. Lave it to me to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip's frosty blue eyes began to melt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I come back rich, I'll be your ould friend again as much as a
      common man may; and if I come back poor and disappointed and done for,
      I'll not claim you to disgrace you; and if I never come back at all, I'll
      be saying to myself in my dark hour somewhere, 'He'll spake up for you at
      home, boy; <i>he'll</i> not forget you.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip could hear no more for the puffing of the steam and the clanking of
      the chains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chut! the talk a man will put out when he's thinking of ould times gone
      by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first bell rang on the bridge, and the harbour-master shouted, &ldquo;All
      ashore, there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phil, there's one turn more I'll ask of you, and, if it's the last, it's
      the biggest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's Kate, you know. Keep an eye on the girl while I'm away. Take a
      slieu round now and then, and put a sight on her. She'll not give a skute
      at the heirs the ould man's telling of; but them young drapers and
      druggists, they'll plague the life out of the girl. Bate them off, Phil.
      They're not worth a fudge with their fists. But don't use no violence.
      Just duck the dandy-divils in the harbour&mdash;that'll do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No harm shall come to her while you are away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swear to it, Phil. Your word's your bond, I know that; but give me your
      hand and swear to it&mdash;it'll be more surer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip gave his hand and his oath, and then tried to turn away, for he
      knew that his face was reddening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! There's another while your hand's in, Phil. Swear that nothing and
      nobody shall ever come between us two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know nothing ever will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But swear to it, Phil. There's bad tongues going, and it'll make me more
      aisier. Whatever they do, whatever they say, friends and brothers to the
      last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip felt a buzzing in his head, and he was so dizzy that he could
      hardly stand, but he took the second oath also. Then the bell rang again,
      and there was a great hubbub. Gangways were drawn up, ropes were let go,
      the captain called to the shore from the bridge, and the blustering
      harbour-master called to the bridge from the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and stand on the end of the pier, Phil&mdash;just aback of the
      lighthouse&mdash;and I'll put myself at the stern. I want a friend's face
      to be the last thing I see when I'm going away from the old home.&rdquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip could bear no more. The hate in his heart was mastered. It was
      under his feet. His flushed face was wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The throbbing of the funnels ceased, and all that could be heard was the
      running of the tide in the harbour and the wash of the waves on the shore.
      Across the sea the sun came up boldly, &ldquo;like a guest expected,&rdquo; and down
      its dancing water-path the steamer moved away. Over the land old Bar-rule
      rose up like a sea king with hoar-frost on his forehead, and the smoke
      began to lift from the chimneys of the town at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, little island, good-bye! I'll not forget you. I'm getting
      kicked out of you, but you've been a good ould mother to me, and, God help
      me, I'll come back to you yet. So long, little Mona, s'long? I'm laving
      you, but I'm a Manxman still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete had meant to take off his stocking cap as they passed the lighthouse,
      and to dash the tears from his eyes like a man. But all that Philip could
      see from the end of the pier was a figure huddled up at the stern on a
      coil of rope.

    <h2>
      I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Auntie Nan had grown uneasy because Philip was not yet started in life.
      During the spell of his partnership with Pete she had protested and he had
      coaxed, she had scolded and he had laughed. But when Pete was gone she
      remembered her old device, and began to play on Philip through the memory
      of his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the air was full of the sea freshness of a beautiful Manx
      November. Philip sniffed it from the porch after breakfast and then
      gathered up his tackle for cod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boat again, Philip?&rdquo; said Auntie Nan. &ldquo;Then promise me to be back for
      tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip gave his promise and kept it. When he returned after his day's
      fishing the old lady was waiting for him in the little blue room which she
      called her own. The sweet place was more than usually dainty and
      comfortable that day. A bright fire was burning, and everything seemed to
      be arranged so carefully and nattily. The table was laid with cups and
      saucers, the kettle was singing on the jockey-bar, and Auntie Nan herself,
      in a cap of black lace and a dress of russet silk with flounces, was
      fluttering about with an odour of lavender and the light gaiety of a bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what's the meaning of this?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the sweet old thing answered, half nervously, half jokingly, &ldquo;You
      don't know? What a child it is, to be sure! So you don't remember what day
      it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What day? The fifth of Nov&mdash;oh, my birthday! I had clean forgotten
      it, Auntie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and you are one-and-twenty for tea-time. That's why I asked you to
      be home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She poured out the tea, settled herself with her feet on the fender,
      allowed the cat to establish itself on her skirt, and then, with a nervous
      smile and a slight depression of the heart, she began on her task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How the years roll on, Philip! It's twenty years since I gave you my
      first birthday present I wasn't here when you were born, dear. Grandfather
      had forbidden me. Poor grandfather! But how I longed to come and wash, and
      dress, and nurse my boy's boy, and call myself an auntie aloud! Oh, dear
      me, the day I first saw you! Shall I ever forget it? Grandfather and I
      were at Cowley, the draper's, when a beautiful young person stepped in
      with a baby. A little too gay, poor thing, and that was how I knew her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear, and grandfather was standing with his back to the street. I
      grow hot to this day when I remember, but she didn't seem afraid. She
      nodded and smiled and lifted the muslin veil from the baby's face, and
      said 'Who's he like, Miss Christian?' It was wonderful. You were asleep,
      and it was the same for all the world as if your father had slept back to
      be a baby. I was trembling fit to drop and couldn't answer, and then your
      mother saw grandfather, and before I could stop her she had touched him on
      the shoulder. He stood with his bad ear towards us, and his sight was
      failing, too, but seeing the form of a lady beside him, he swept round,
      and bowed low, and smiled and raised his hat, as his way was with all
      women. Then your mother held the baby up and said quite gaily, 'Is it one
      of the Ballures he is, Dempster, or one of the Ballawhaines?' Dear heart
      when I think of it! Grandfather straightened himself up, turned about, and
      was out on the street in an instant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor father!&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Auntie Nan's eyes brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to tell you of your first birthday, dearest. Grandfather had
      gone then&mdash;poor grandfather!&mdash;and I had knitted you a little
      soft cap of white wool, with a tassel and a pink bow. Your mother's father
      was living still&mdash;Capt'n Billy, as they called him&mdash;and when I
      put the cap on your little head, he cried out, 'A sailor every inch of
      him!' And sure enough, though I had never thought it, a sailor's cap it
      was. And Capt'n Billy put you on his knee, and looked at you sideways, and
      slapped his thigh, and blew a cloud of smoke from his long pipe and cried
      again, 'This boy is for a sailor, I'm telling you.' You fell asleep in the
      old man's arms, and I carried you to your cot upstairs. Your father
      followed me into the bedroom, and your mother was there already dusting
      the big shells on the mantelpiece. Poor Tom! I see him yet. He dropped his
      long white hand over the cot-rail, pushed back the little cap and the
      yellow curls from your forehead, and said proudly, 'Ah, no, this head
      wasn't built for a sailor!' He meant no harm, but&mdash;Oh, dear, Oh,
      dear!&mdash;your mother heard him, and thought he was belittling her and
      hers. 'These qualities!' she cried, and slashed the duster and flounced
      out of the room, and one of the shells fell with a clank into the fender.
      Your father turned his face to the window. I could have cried for shame
      that he should be ashamed before me. But looking out on the sea,&mdash;the
      bay was very loud that day, I remember&mdash;he said in his deep voice,
      that was like a mellow bell, and trembled ratherly, 'It's not for nothing,
      Nannie, that the child has the forehead of Napoleon. Only let God spare
      him and he'll be something some day, when his father, with his broken
      heart and his broken brain, is dead and gone, and the daisies cover him.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Auntie Nan carried her point. That night Philip laid up his boat for the
      winter, and next morning he set his face towards Ballawhaine with the
      object of enlisting Uncle Peter's help in starting upon the profession of
      the law. Auntie Nan went with him. She had urged him to the step by the
      twofold plea that the Ballawhaine was his only male relative of mature
      years, and that he had lately sent his own son Ross to study for the bar
      in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both were nervous and uncertain on the way down; Auntie Nan talked
      incessantly from under her poke-bonnet, thinking to keep up Philip's
      courage. But when they came to the big gate and looked up at the turrets
      through the trees, her memory went back with deep tenderness to the days
      when the house had been her home, and she began to cry in silence. Philip
      himself was not unmoved. This had been the birthplace and birthright of
      his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English footman, in buff and scarlet, ushered them into the
      drawing-room with the formality proper to strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      To their surprise they found Ross there. He was sitting at the piano
      strumming a music-hall ditty. As the door opened be shuffled to his feet,
      shook hands distantly with Auntie Nan, and nodded his head to Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man was by this time a sapling well fed from the old tree.
      Taller than his father by many inches, broader, heavier, and larger in all
      ways, with the slow eyes of a seal and something of a seal's face as well.
      But with his father's sprawling legs and his father's levity and irony of
      manner and of voice&mdash;a Manxman disguised out of all recognition of
      race, and apeing the fashionable follies of the hour in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Auntie Nan settled her umbrella, smoothed her gloves and her white front
      hair, and inquired meekly if he was well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very fit,&rdquo; he drawled; &ldquo;shouldn't be here if I were. But father
      worried my life out until I came back to recruit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Auntie Nan, looking simple and sympathetic, &ldquo;perhaps
      you've been longing for home. It must be a great trial to a young man to
      live in London for the first time. That's where a young woman has the
      advantage&mdash;she needn't leave home, at all events. Then your lodgings,
      perhaps they are not in the best part either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to have chambers in an Inn of Court&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Auntie Nan looked concerned. &ldquo;I don't think I should like Philip to live
      long at an inn,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now I'm in rooms in the Hay market.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Auntie Nan looked relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be better,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Noisy in the mornings, perhaps, but your
      evenings will be quiet for study, I should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Boss, with a snigger, touching the piano again, and
      Philip, sitting near the door, felt the palm of his hand itch for the
      whole breadth of his cousin's cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Peter came in hurriedly, with short, nervous steps. His hair as well
      as his eyebrows was now white, his eye was hollow, his cheeks were thin,
      his mouth was restless, and he had lost some of his upper teeth, he
      coughed frequently, he was shabbily dressed, and had the look of a dying
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it's you, Anne! and Philip, too. Good morning, Philip. Give the piano
      a rest, Ross&mdash;that's a good lad. Well, Miss Christian, well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip came of age yesterday, Peter,&rdquo; said Auntie Nan in a timid voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said the Ballawhaine, &ldquo;then Ross is twenty next month. A little
      more than a year and a month between them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He scrutinised the old lady's face for a moment without speaking, and then
      said, &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would like to go to London to study for the bar,&rdquo; faltered Auntie Nan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not the church at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The church would have been my own choice, Peter, but his father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Ballawhaine crossed his leg over his knee. &ldquo;His father was always a
      man of a high stomach, ma'am,&rdquo; he said. Then facing towards Philip, &ldquo;Your
      idea would be to return to the island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Practice as an advocate, and push your way to insular preferment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father seemed to wish it, sir,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ballawhaine turned back to Auntie Nan. &ldquo;Well, Miss Christian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Auntie Nan fumbled the handle of her umbrella and began&mdash;&ldquo;We were
      thinking, Peter&mdash;you see we know so little&mdash;now if his father
      had been living&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Ballawhaine coughed, scratched with his nail on his cheek, and said,
      &ldquo;You wish me to put him with a barrister in chambers, is that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a nervous smile and a little laugh of relief Auntie Nan signified
      assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are aware that a step like that costs money. How much have you got to
      spend on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid, Peter&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought I might find the expenses, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's so good of you to see it in the right way, Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Ballawhaine made a wry face. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said dryly. &ldquo;Ross has just
      gone to study for the English bar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Auntie Nan eagerly, &ldquo;and it was partly that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said the Ballawhaine, raising his eyebrows. &ldquo;I calculate that
      his course in London will cost me, one thing with another, more than a
      thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Auntie Nan lifted her gloved hands in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sum I am prepared to spend in order that my son, as an English
      barrister, may have a better chance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, we were thinking of that ourselves, Peter?&rdquo; said Auntie Nan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A better chance,&rdquo; the Ballawhaine continued, &ldquo;of the few places open in
      the island than if he were brought up at the Manx bar only, which would
      cost me less than half as much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but the money will come back to you, both for Ross and Philip,&rdquo; said
      Auntie Nan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ballawhaine coughed impatiently. &ldquo;You don't read me,&rdquo; he said
      irritably. &ldquo;These places are few, and Manx advocates are as thick as flies
      in a glue-pot. For every office there must be fifty applicants, but
      training counts for something, and influence for something, and family for
      something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Auntie Nan began to be penetrated as by a chill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These,&rdquo; said the Ballawhaine, &ldquo;I bring to bear for Ross, that he may
      distance all competitors. Do you read me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read you, Peter?&rdquo; said Auntie Nan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ballawhaine fixed his hollow eye upon her, and said, &ldquo;What do you ask
      me to do? You come here and ask me to provide, prepare, and equip a rival
      to my own son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Auntie Nan had grasped his meaning at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But gracious me, Peter,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Philip is your own nephew, your own
      brother's son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Ballawhaine rubbed the side of his nose with his lean forefinger, and
      said, &ldquo;Near is my shirt, but nearer is my skin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Auntie Nan fixed her timid eyes upon him, and they grew brave in their
      gathering indignation. &ldquo;His father is dead, and he is poor and
      friendless,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've had differences on that subject before, mistress,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you begrudge him the little that would start him in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own has earlier claim, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saving your presence, sir, let me tell you that every penny of the money
      you are spending on Ross would have been Philip's this day if things had
      gone different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Ballawhaine bit his lip. &ldquo;Must I, for my sins, be compelled to put an
      end to this interview?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose to go to the door. Philip rose also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean it?&rdquo; said Auntie Nan. &ldquo;Would you dare to turn me out of the
      house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Auntie, what's the use?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ballawhaine was drumming on the edge of the open door. &ldquo;You are right,
      young man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a woman's hysteria is of <i>no</i> use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, sir,&rdquo; said Philip in a firm voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ballawhaine put his hand familiarly on Philip's shoulder. &ldquo;Try Bishop
      Wilson's theological college, my friend; its cheap and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your hand from him, Peter Christian,&rdquo; cried Auntie Nan. Her eyes
      flashed, her cheeks were aflame, her little gloved hands were clenched.
      &ldquo;You made war between his father and your father, and when I would have
      made peace you prevented me. Your father is dead, and your brother is
      dead, and both died in hate that might have died in love, only for the
      lies you told and the deceit you practised. But they have gone where the
      mask falls from all faces, and they have met before this, eye to eye, and
      hand to hand. Yes, and they are looking down on you now, Peter Christian,
      and they know you at last for what you are and always have been&mdash;a
      deceiver and a thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By an involuntary impulse the Ballawhaine turned his eyes upward to the
      ceiling while she spoke, as if he had expected to see the ghosts of his
      father and his brother threatening him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the woman mad at all?&rdquo; he cried; and the timid old lady, lifted out of
      herself by the flame of her anger, blazed at him again with a tongue of
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done wrong, Peter Christian, much wrong; you've done wrong all
      your days, and whatever your motive, God will find it out, and on that
      secret place he will bring your punishment. If it was only greed, you've
      got your wages; but no good will they bring to you, for another will spend
      them, and you will see them wasted like water from the ragged rock. And if
      it was hate as well, you will live till it comes back on your own head
      like burning coal. I know it, I feel it,&rdquo; she cried, sweeping into the
      hall, &ldquo;and sorry I am to say it before your own son, who ought to honour
      and respect his father, but can't; no, he can't and never will, or else he
      has a heart to match your own in wickedness, and no bowels of compassion
      at him either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Auntie, come,&rdquo; said Philip, putting his arm about the old lady's
      waist. But she swerved round again to where the Ballawhaine came slinking
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn me out of the house, will you?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;The place where I lived
      fifteen years, and as mistress, too, until your evil deeds made you
      master. Many a good cry I've had that it's only a woman I am, and can do
      nothing on my own head. But I would rather be a woman that hasn't a roof
      to cover her than a man that can't warm to his own flesh and blood. Don't
      think I begrudge you your house, Peter Christian, though it was my old
      home, and I love it, for all I'm shown no respect in it I would have you
      to know, sir, that it isn't our houses we live in after all, but our
      hearts&mdash;our hearts, Peter Christian&mdash;do you hear me?&mdash;our
      hearts, and yours is full of darkness and dirt&mdash;and always will be,
      always will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Auntie, come,&rdquo; cried Philip again, and the sweet old thing,
      too gentle to hurt a fly, turned on him also with the fury of a wild-cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go along yourself with your 'come' and 'come' and 'come.' Say less and do
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that final outburst she swept down the steps and along the path,
      leaving Philip three paces behind, and the Ballawhaine with a terrified
      look under the stuffed cormorant in the fanlight above the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fiery mood lasted her half way home, and then broke down in a torrent
      of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear! oh dear!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I've been too hasty. After all, he is your
      only relative. What shall I do now? Oh, what shall I do now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was walking steadily half a step behind, and he had never once
      spoken since they left Ballawhaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pack my bag to-night, Auntie,&rdquo; said he with the voice of a man; &ldquo;I shall
      start for Douglas by the coach to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sought out the best known of the Manx advocates, a college friend of
      his father's, and said to him, &ldquo;I've sixty pounds a year, sir, from my
      mother's father, and my aunt has enough of her own to live on. Can I
      afford to pay your premium?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer looked at him attentively for a moment, and answered, &ldquo;No, you
      can't,&rdquo; and Philip's face began to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'll take you the five years for nothing, Mr. Christian,&rdquo; the wise
      man added, &ldquo;and if you suit me, I'll give you wages after two.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Philip did not forget the task wherewith Pete had charged him. It is a
      familiar duty in the Isle of Man, and he who discharges it is known by a
      familiar name. They call him the <i>Dooiney Molla</i>&mdash;literally, the
      &ldquo;man-praiser;&rdquo; and his primary function is that of an informal,
      unmercenary, purely friendly and philanthropic matchmaker, introduced by
      the young man to persuade the parents of the young woman that he is a
      splendid fellow, with substantial possessions or magnificent prospects,
      and entirely fit to marry her. But he has a secondary function, less
      frequent, though scarcely less familiar; and it is that of lover by proxy,
      or intended husband by deputy, with duties of moral guardianship over the
      girl while the man himself is off &ldquo;at the herrings,&rdquo; or away &ldquo;at the
      mackerel,&rdquo; or abroad on wider voyages.
    </p>
    <p>
      This second task, having gone through the first with dubious success,
      Philip discharged with conscientious zeal. The effects were peculiar.
      Their earliest manifestations were, as was most proper, on Philip and Kate
      themselves. Philip grew to be grave and wondrous solemn, for assuming the
      tone of guardian lifted his manners above all levity. Kate became suddenly
      very quiet and meek, very watchful and modest, soft of voice and most apt
      to blush. The girl who had hectored it over Pete and played little
      mistress over everybody else, grew to be like a dove under the eye of
      Philip. A kind of awe fell on her whenever he was near. She found it sweet
      to listen to his words of wisdom when he discoursed, and sweeter still to
      obey his will when he gave commands. The little wistful head was always
      turning in his direction; his voice was like joy-bells in her ears; his
      parting how under his lifted hat remained with her as a dream until the
      following day. She hardly knew what great change had been wrought in her,
      and her people at home were puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not very well you are, Kirry, woman?&rdquo; said Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well enough, mother; why not?&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it the toothache that's plaguing you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then maybe it's the new hat in the window at Miss Clu-cas's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hould your tongue, woman,&rdquo; whispered Cæsar behind the back of his hand.
      &ldquo;It's the Spirit that's working on the girl. Give it lave, mother; give it
      lave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it fiddlesticks,&rdquo; said Nancy Joe. &ldquo;Give it brimstone and treacle and
      a cupful of wormwood and camomile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Philip and Kate were together, their talk was all of Pete. It was
      &ldquo;Pete likes this,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pete hates that,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pete always says so and
      so.&rdquo; That was their way of keeping up the recollection of Pete's
      existence; and the uses they put poor Pete to were many and peculiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night &ldquo;The Manx Fairy&rdquo; was merry and noisy with a &ldquo;Scaltha,&rdquo; a
      Christmas supper given by the captain of a fishing-boat to the crew that
      he meant to engage for the season. Wives, sweethearts, and friends were
      there, and the customs and superstitions of the hour were honoured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it the funniest thing in the world, Philip?&rdquo; giggled Kate from the
      back of the door, and a moment afterwards she was standing alone with him
      in the lobby, looking demurely down at his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I ought to apologise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For calling you that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete calls me Philip. Why shouldn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The furtive eyes rose to the buttons of his waistcoat. &ldquo;Well, no; there
      can't be much harm in calling you what Pete calls you, can there? But then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He calls me Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he would like me to do so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure he would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just for Pete's sake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They didn't know what they felt. It was something exquisite, something
      delicious; so sweet, so tender, they could only laugh as if some one had
      tickled them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, we need not do it except when we are quite by ourselves,&rdquo; said
      Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, of course not, only when we are quite alone,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they threw dust into each other's eyes, and walked hand in hand on
      the edge of a precipice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last day of the old year after Pete's departure found Philip attending
      to his duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to put the new year in anywhere, Philip?&rdquo; said Kate, from
      the door of the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be the first-foot here, only I'm no use as a qualtagh,&rdquo; said
      Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a fair man, and would bring you no luck, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment, and then Kate cried &ldquo;<i>I</i> know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come for Pete&mdash;he's dark enough, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was much impressed. &ldquo;That's a good idea,&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;Being
      qualtagh for Pete is a good idea. His first New Year from home, too, poor
      fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll expect you at the very stroke of twelve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was going off. &ldquo;And, Philip!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a low voice, so soft, so sweet, so merry, came from the doorway into
      the dark, &ldquo;I'll be standing at the door of the dairy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip began to feel alarm, and resolved to take for the future a lighter
      view of his duties. He would visit &ldquo;The Manx Fairy&rdquo; less frequently. As
      soon as the Christmas holidays were over he would devote himself to his
      studies, and come back to Sulby no more for half a year. But the Manx
      Christmas is long. It begins on the 24th of December, and only ends for
      good on the 6th of January. In the country places, which still preserve
      the old traditions, the culminating day is Twelfth Day. It is then that
      they &ldquo;cut off the fiddler's head,&rdquo; and play valentines, which they call
      the &ldquo;Goggans.&rdquo; The girls set a row of mugs on the hearth in front of the
      fire, put something into each of them as a symbol of a trade, and troop
      out to the stairs. Then the boys change the order of the mugs, and the
      girls come back blindfold, one by one, to select their goggans. According
      to the goggans they lay hands on, so will be the trades of their husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this game, played at &ldquo;The Manx Fairy&rdquo; on the last night of Philip's
      holiday, Csesar being abroad on an evangelising errand, Kate was expected
      to draw water, but she drew a quill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pen! A pen!&rdquo; cried the boys. &ldquo;Who says the girl is to marry a sailor?
      The ship isn't built that's to drown her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night all,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Mr. Christian, good-night, sir,&rdquo; said the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate slipped after him to the door. &ldquo;Going so early, Philip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've to be back at Douglas to-morrow morning,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we shan't see you very soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I must set to work in earnest now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fortnight&mdash;a month may be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and six months&mdash;I intend to do nothing else for half a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a long time, isn't it, Philip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so long as I've wasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasted? So you call it wasted? Of course, it's nothing to me&mdash;but
      there's your aunt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man can't always be dangling about women,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm so glad I'm a girl,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so am I,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It came at his face like a flash of lightning, and Philip stammered, &ldquo;I
      mean&mdash;that is&mdash;you know&mdash;what about Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is that all? Well, good-night, if you must go. Shall I bring you the
      lantern? No need? Starlight, is it? You can see your way to the gate quite
      plainly? Very well, if you don't want showing. Good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last words, in an injured tone, were half lost behind the closing
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the heart of a girl is a dark forest, and Kate had determined that,
      work or no work, so long a spell as six months Philip should not be away.

    <h2>
      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One morning in the late spring there came to Douglas a startling and most
      appalling piece of news&mdash;-Ross Christian was constantly seen at &ldquo;The
      Manx Fairy.&rdquo; On the evening of that day Philip reappeared at Sulby. He had
      come down in high wrath, inventing righteous speeches by the way on
      plighted troths and broken pledges. Ross was there in lacquered boots,
      light kid gloves, frock coat, and pepper and salt trousers, leaning with
      elbow on the counter, that he might talk to Kate, who was serving. Philip
      had never before seen her at that task, and his indignation was extreme.
      He was more than ever sure that Grannie was a simpleton and Cæsar a brazen
      hypocrite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate nodded gaily to him as he entered, and then continued her
      conversation with Ross. There was a look in her eyes that was new to him,
      and it caused him to change his purpose. He would not be indignant, he
      would be cynical, he would be nasty, he would wait his opportunity and put
      in with some cutting remark. So, at Cæsar's invitation and Grannie's
      welcome, he pushed through the bar-room to the kitchen, exchanged
      salutations, and then sat down to watch and to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation beyond the glass partition was eager and enthusiastic.
      Ross was fluent and Kate was vivacious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend Monty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; who is Monty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's the centre of the Fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Fancy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ornaments of the Ring, you know. Come now, surely you know the Ring, my
      dear. His rooms in St. James's Street are full of them every night. All
      sorts, you know&mdash;featherweights, and heavy-weights, and greyhounds.
      And the faces! My goodness, you should see them. Such worn-out old images.
      Knowledge boxes all awry, mouths crooked, and noses that have had the
      upper-cut. But good men all; good to take their gruel, you know. Monty
      will have nothing else about him. He was Tom Spring's packer. Never heard
      of Tom Spring? Tom of Bedford, the incorruptible, you know, only he fought
      cross that day. Monty lost a thousand, and Tom keeps a public in Holborn
      now with pictures of the Fancy round the walls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Kate, with a laugh, said something which Philip did not catch,
      because Cæsar was rustling the newspaper he was reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies come?&rdquo; said Ross. &ldquo;Girls at Monty's suppers? Rather! what should
      you think? Cleopatra&mdash;but you ought to be there. I must be getting
      off myself very soon. There's a supper coming off next week at Handsome
      Honey's. Who's Honey? Proprietor of a night-house in the Haymarket.
      Night-house? You come and see, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar dropped the newspaper and looked across at Philip. The gaze was long
      and embarrassing, and, for want of better conversation, Philip asked Cæsar
      if he was thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, thinking, thinking, and thinking again, sir,&rdquo; said Cæsar. Then,
      drawing his chair nearer to Philip's, he added, in a half whisper, &ldquo;I'm
      getting a bit of a skute into something, though. See yonder? They're
      calling his father a miser. The man's racking his tenants and starving his
      land. But I believe enough the young brass lagh (a weed) is choking the
      ould grain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar, as he spoke, tipped his thumb over his shoulder in the direction of
      Ross, and, seeing this, Ross interrupted his conversation with Kate to
      address himself to her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you've been reading the paper, Mr. Cregeen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, reading and reading,&rdquo; said Cæsar grumpily. Then in another tone,
      &ldquo;You're home again from London, sir? Great doings yonder, they're telling
      me. Battles, sir, great battles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ross elevated his eyebrows. &ldquo;Have you heard of them then?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, heard enough,&rdquo; said Cæsar, &ldquo;meetings, and conferences, and
      conventions, and I don't know what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh, I see,&rdquo; said Ross, with a look at Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're doing without hell in England now-a-days&mdash;that's a quare
      thing, sir. Conditional immorality they're calling it&mdash;the singlerest
      thing I know. Taking hell away drops the tailboard out of a man's
      religion, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The time for closing came, and Philip had waited in vain. Only one cut had
      come his way, and that had not been his own. As he rose to go, Kate had
      said, &ldquo;We didn't expect to see you again for six months, Mr. Christian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it seems,&rdquo; said Philip, and Kate laughed a little, and that was all
      the work of his evening, and the whole result of his errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar was waiting for him in the porch. His face was white, and it
      twitched visibly. It was plain to see that the natural man was fighting in
      Cæsar. &ldquo;Mr. Christian, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are you the gentleman that came
      here to speak to me for Peter Quilliam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do you remember the ould Manx saying, 'Perhaps the last dog may be
      catching the hare?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave it to me, Mr. Cregeen,&rdquo; said Philip through his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a minute afterwards he was swinging down the dark road homewards, by
      the side of Ross, who was drawling along with his cold voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you've started on your light-weight handicap, Philip. Father was
      monstrous unreasonable that day. Seemed to think I was coming back here to
      put my shoulder out for your high bailiffships and bum-bailiffships and
      heaven knows what. You're welcome to the lot for me, Philip. That girl's
      wonderful, though. It's positively miraculous, too; she's the living
      picture of a girl of my friend Montague's. Eyes, hair, that nervous
      movement of the mouth&mdash;everything. Old man looked glum enough,
      though. Poor little woman. I suppose she's past praying for. The old
      hypocrite will hold her like a dove in the claws of a buzzard hawk till
      she throws herself away on some Manx omathaun. It's the way with half
      these pretty creatures&mdash;they're wasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip's blood was boiling. &ldquo;Do you call it being wasted when a good girl
      is married to an honest man?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do; because a girl like this can never marry the right man. The man who
      is worthy of her cannot marry her, and the man who marries her isn't
      worthy of her. It's like this, Philip. She's young, she's pretty, perhaps
      beautiful, has manners and taste, and some refinement. The man of her own
      class is clumsy and ignorant, and stupid and poor. She doesn't want him,
      and the man she does want the man she's fit for&mdash;daren't marry her;
      it would be social suicide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said Philip bitterly, &ldquo;to save the man above from social
      suicide, the girl beneath must choose moral death&mdash;is that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ross laughed. &ldquo;Do you know I thought old Jeremiah was at you in the corner
      there, Philip. But look at it straight. Here's a girl like that. Two
      things are open to her&mdash;two only. Say she marries your Manx fellow,
      what follows? A thatched cottage three fields back from the mountain road,
      two rooms, a cowhouse, a crock, a dresser, a press, a form, a three-legged
      stool, an armchair, and a clock with a dirty face, hanging on a nail in
      the wall. Milking, weeding, digging, ninepence a day, and a can of
      buttermilk, with a lump of butter thrown in. Potatoes, herrings, and
      barley bonnag. Year one, a baby, a boy; year two, another baby, a girl;
      year three, twins; year four, barefooted children squalling, dirty house,
      man grumbling, woman distracted, measles, hooping-cough; a journey at the
      tail of a cart to the bottom of the valley, and the awful words 'I am the&mdash;&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush man!&rdquo; said Philip. They were passing Lezayre churchyard. When they
      had left it behind, he added, with a grim curl of the lip, which was lost
      in the darkness, &ldquo;Well, that's one side. What's the other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life,&rdquo; said Ross. &ldquo;Short and sweet, perhaps. Everything she wants,
      everything she can wish for&mdash;five years, four years, three years&mdash;what
      matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one for himself and God for us all, my boy. She's as happy as the
      day while it lasts, lifts her head like a rosebud in the sun&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then drops it, I suppose, like a rose-leaf in the mud.&rdquo; Ross laughed
      again. &ldquo;Yes, it's a fact, old Jeremiah <i>has</i> been at you, Philip.
      Poor little Kitty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep the girl's name out of it, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ross gave a long whistle. &ldquo;I was only saying the poor little woman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's damnable, and I'll have no more of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no duty on speech, I hope, in your precious Isle of Man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is, though,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;a duty of decency and honour, and to
      name that girl, foolish as she is, in the same breath with your women&mdash;But
      here, listen to me. Best tell you now, so there may be no mistake and no
      excuse. Miss Cregeen is to be married to a friend of mine. I needn't say
      who he is&mdash;he comes close enough to you at all events. When he's at
      home, he's able to take care of his own affairs; but while he's abroad
      I've got to see that no harm comes to his promised wife. I mean to do it,
      too. Do you understand me, Ross? I mean to do it. Good night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were at the gate of Ballawhaine by this time, and Ross went through
      it giggling.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following evening found Philip at &ldquo;The Manx Fairy&rdquo; again. Ross was
      there as usual, and he was laughing and talking in a low tone with Kate.
      This made Philip squirm on his chair, but Kate's behaviour tortured him.
      Her enjoyment of the man's jests was almost uproarious. She was signalling
      to him and peering up at him gaily. Her conduct disgusted Philip. It
      seemed to him an aggravation of her offence that as often as he caught the
      look of her face there was a roguish twinkle in the eye on his side, and a
      deliberate cast in his direction. This open disregard of the sanctity of a
      pledged word, this barefaced indifference to the presence of him who stood
      to represent it, was positively indecent. This was what women were! Deceit
      was bred in their bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      It added to Philip's gathering wrath that Cæsar, who sat in shirt-sleeves
      making up his milling accounts from slates ciphered with crosses, and
      triangles, and circles, and half circles, was lifting his eyes from time
      to time to look first at them and then at him, with an expression of
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a burst of fresh laughter and a shot of the bright eyes, Philip surged
      up to his feet, thrust himself between Ross and Kate, turned his back on
      him and his face to her, and said in a peremptory voice, &ldquo;Come into the
      parlour instantly&mdash;I have something to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she came, looking mischievous and yet demure, with her head down but
      her eyes peering under their long upper lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you send this fellow about his business?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate looked up in blank surprise. &ldquo;What fellow?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What fellow?&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;why, this one that is shillyshallying with
      you night after night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can never mean your own cousin, Philip?&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More's the pity if he is my cousin, but he's no fit company for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure the gentleman is polite enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So's the devil himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can behave and keep his temper, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it's the only thing he can keep. He can't keep his character or his
      credit or his honor, and you should not encourage him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate's under lip began to show the inner half. &ldquo;Who says I encourage him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What right have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't I seen you with my own eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate grew defiant. &ldquo;Well, and what if you have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are a jade and a coquette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word hissed out like steam from a kettle. Kate saw it coming and took
      it full in the face. She felt an impulse to scream with laughter, so she
      seized her opportunity and cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip's temper began to ebb. &ldquo;That man would be a poor bargain, Kate, if
      he were twenty times the heir of Ballawhaine. Can't you gather from his
      conversation what his life and companions are? Of course it's nothing to
      me, Kate&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it's nothing to you,&rdquo; whimpered Kate, from behind both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've no right&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not; you've no right,&rdquo; said Kate, and she stole a look
      sideways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip did not see the glance that came from the corner of Kate's eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a girl forgets a manly fellow, who happens to be abroad, for the
      first rascal that comes along with his dirty lands&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down went the hands with an impatient fling. &ldquo;What are his lands to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it's my duty as a friend&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duty indeed! Just what every old busybody says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip gripped her wrist. &ldquo;Listen to me. If you don't send this man
      packing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are hurting me. Let go my arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip flung it aside and said, &ldquo;What do I care?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you call me a coquette?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do as you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I will. Philip! Philip! Phil! He's gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was twenty miles by coach and rail from Douglas to Sulby, but Philip
      was back at &ldquo;The Manx Fairy&rdquo; the next evening also. He found a
      saddle-horse linked to the gate-post and Ross inside the house with a
      riding-whip in his hand, beating the leg of his riding-breeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Philip appeared, Kate began to look alarmed, and Ross to look ugly.
      Cæsar, who was taking his tea in the ingle, was having an unpleasant
      passage with Grannie in side-breaths by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad, bad, a notorious bad liver and dirty with the tongue,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chut, father!&rdquo; said Grannie. &ldquo;The young man's civil enough, and girls
      will be girls. What's a word or a look or a laugh when you're young and
      have a face that's fit for anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better her face should be pitted with smallpox than bring her to the pit
      of hell,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;All flesh is grass: the grass withereth, the flower
      fadeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy Joe came from the dairy at that moment. &ldquo;Gracious me I did you see
      that now?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wonder at Kitty. But it's the way of the men,
      smiling and smiling and maning nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm! They mane a dale,&rdquo; growled Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ross had recovered from his uneasiness at Philip's entrance, and was
      engaged in some narration whereof the only words that reached the kitchen
      were <i>I know</i> and <i>I know</i> repeated frequently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to know a dale, sir,&rdquo; shouted Cæsar; &ldquo;do you know what it is to
      be saved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment, and then Ross, polishing his massive
      signet ring on his corduroy waistcoat, said, &ldquo;Is that the old gentleman's
      complaint, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband is a local preacher and always strong for salvation,&rdquo; said
      Grannie by way of peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; said Ross. &ldquo;I thought perhaps he had taken more wine than
      the sacrament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're my cross, woman,&rdquo; muttered Cæsar, &ldquo;but no cross no crown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lave women's matters alone, father; it'll become you better,&rdquo; said
      Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laugh as you like, Mistress Cregeen; there's One above, there's One
      above.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ross had resumed his conversation with Kate, who was looking frightened.
      And listening with all his ears, Philip caught the substance of what was
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm due back by this time. There's the supper at Handsome Honey's, not to
      speak of the everlasting examinations. But somehow I can't tear myself
      away. Why not? Can't you guess? No? Not a notion? I would go to-morrow&mdash;Kitty,
      a word in your ear&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe in my heart that man is for kissing her,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;If he
      does, then by&mdash;he's done it! Hould, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar had risen to his feet, and in a moment the house was in an uproar.
      Ross lifted his head like a cock. &ldquo;Were you speaking to me, mister?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was, and don't demane yourself like that again,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; said Ross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paying coort to a girl that isn't fit for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ross lifted his hat, &ldquo;Do you mean this young lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No young lady at all, sir, but the daughter of a plain, respectable man
      that isn't going to see her fooled. Your hat to your head, sir. You'll be
      wanting it for the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; cried Kate, in a voice of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar turned his rough shoulder and said, &ldquo;Go to your room, ma'am, and
      keep it for a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may go,&rdquo; said Ross. &ldquo;I'll spare the old simpleton for your sake,
      Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll spare me, sir?&rdquo; cried Cæsar. &ldquo;I've seen the day&mdash;but thank
      the Lord for restraining grace! Spare me? If you had said as much
      five-and-twenty years ago, sir, your head would have gone ringing against
      the wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll spare you no more, then,&rdquo; said Ross. &ldquo;Take that&mdash;and that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amid screams from the women, two sounding blows fell on Cæsar's face. At
      the next instant Philip was standing between the two men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come this way,&rdquo; he said, addressing Ross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I like,&rdquo; Ross answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way, I tell you,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ross snapped his fingers. &ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; he said, and then followed
      Philip out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate had run upstairs in terror, but five minutes afterwards she was on
      the road, with a face full of distress, and a shawl over head and
      shoulders. At the bridge she met Kelly, the postman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which way have they gone,&rdquo; she panted, &ldquo;the young Ballawhaine and Philip
      Christian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw them heading down to the Curragh,&rdquo; said Kelly, and Kate in the
      shawl, flew like a bird over the ground in that direction.

    <h2>
      V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The two young men went on without a word. Philip walked with long strides
      three paces in front, with head thrown back, pallid face and contracted
      features, mouth firmly shut, arms stiff by his side, and difficult and
      audible breathing. Ross slouched behind with an air of elaborate
      carelessness, his horse beside him, the reins over its head and round his
      arm, the riding-whip under his other arm-pit, and both his hands deep in
      the breeches pockets. There was no road the way they went, but only a cart
      track, interrupted here and there by a gate, and bordered by square turf
      pits half full of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days were long and the light was not yet failing. Beyond the gorse,
      the willows, the reeds, the rushes and the sally bushes of the flat land,
      the sun was setting over a streak of gold on the sea. They had left behind
      them the smell of burning turf, of crackling sticks, of fish, and of the
      cowhouse, and were come into the atmosphere of flowering gorse and damp
      scraa soil and brine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far enough, aren't we?&rdquo; shouted Ross, but Philip pushed on. He drew up at
      last in an open space, where the gorse had been burnt away and its black
      remains desolated the surface and killed the odours of life. There was not
      a house near, not a landmark in sight, except a windmill on the sea's
      verge, and the ugly tower of a church, like the funnel of a steamship
      between sea and sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're alone at last,&rdquo; he said hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are,&rdquo; said Ross, interrupting the whistling of a tune, &ldquo;and now that
      you've got me here, perhaps you'll be good enough to tell me what we've
      come for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip made no more answer than to strip himself of his coat and
      waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're never going to make a serious business of this stupid affair?&rdquo;
       said Ross, leaning against the horse and slapping the sole of one foot
      with the whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take off your coat,&rdquo; said Philip in a thick voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I help it if a pretty girl&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Ross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you strip?&rdquo; cried Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ross laughed. &ldquo;Ah! now I remember our talk of the other night. But you
      don't mean to say,&rdquo; he said, flipping at the flies at the horse's head,
      &ldquo;that because the little woman is forgetting the curmudgeon that's abroad&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip strode up to him with clenched hands and quivering lips and said,
      &ldquo;Will you fight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ross laughed again, but the blood was in his face, and he said tauntingly,
      &ldquo;I wouldn't distress myself, man. Daresay I'll be done with the girl
      before the fellow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a scoundrel,&rdquo; cried Philip, &ldquo;and if you won't stand up to me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ross flung away his whip. &ldquo;If I must, I must,&rdquo; he said, and then threw the
      horse's reins round the charred arm of a half-destroyed gorse tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute afterwards the young men stood face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said Ross, &ldquo;let me tell you first; it's only fair. Since I went up
      to London I've learnt a thing or two. I've stood up before men that can
      strip a picture; I've been opposite talent and I can peck a bit, but I've
      never heard that you can stop a blow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; cried Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you will. You shall have one round, you'll want no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young men looked badly matched. Ross, in riding-breeches and shirt,
      with red bullet head and sprawling feet, arms like an oak and veins like
      willow boughs. Philip in shirt and knickerbockers, with long fair hair,
      quivering face, and delicate figure. It was strength and some skill
      against nerve alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a rush of wind Philip came on, striking right and left, and was
      driven back by a left-hand body-blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you've got it,&rdquo; said Ross, smiling benignly. &ldquo;Didn't I tell you?
      That's old Bristol Bull to begin with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip rushed on again, and came back with a smashing blow that cut his
      nether lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got a second,&rdquo; said Ross. &ldquo;Have you had enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip did not hear, but sprang fiercely at Ross once more. The next
      instant he was on the ground. Then Ross took on a manner of utter
      contempt. &ldquo;I can't keep on flipping at you all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mock me when you've beaten me,&rdquo; said Philip, and he was on his feet
      again, somewhat blown, but fresh as to spirit and doggedly resolute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toe the scratch, then,&rdquo; said Ross. &ldquo;I must say you're good at your
      gruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip flung himself on his man a third time, and fell more heavily than
      before, under a flush hit that seemed to bury itself in his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't go on fighting a man that's as good for nothing as my old
      grandmother,&rdquo; said Ross.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his contempt was abating; he was growing uneasy; Philip was before him
      as fierce as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fight your equal,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll fight you,&rdquo; growled Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not fit. Give it up. And look, the dark is falling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's enough daylight yet. Come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody is here to shame you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip did not wait, but sprang on his man like a tiger. Ross met his
      blow, dodged, feinted; they gripped, swinging to and fro; there was a
      struggle, and Philip fell again with a dull thud against the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you stop now?&rdquo; said Ross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; cried Philip, leaping to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll eat you up. I'm a glutton, I can tell you.&rdquo; But his voice trembled,
      and Philip, blind with passion, laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be hurt,&rdquo; said Ross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of that?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm willing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ross tried to laugh mockingly, but the hoarse gurgle choked in his throat.
      He began to tremble. &ldquo;This man doesn't know when he's mauled,&rdquo; he
      muttered, and after a loud curse he stood up afresh, with a craven and
      shifty look. His blows fell like scorching missiles, but Philip took them
      like a rock scoured with shingle, raining blood like water, but standing
      firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the use?&rdquo; cried Ross; &ldquo;drop it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll drop myself first,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you won't give it up, I will,&rdquo; said Ross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shan't,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your victory if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say you've licked me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do it first,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ross laughed long and riotously, but he was trembling like a whipped cur.
      With a blob of foam on his lips he came up, collecting all his strength,
      and struck Philip a blow on the forehead that fell with the sound of a
      hammer on a coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you done?&rdquo; he snuffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by God,&rdquo; cried Philip, black as ink with the burnt gorse from the
      ground, except where the blood ran red on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man means to kill me,&rdquo; mumbled Ross. He looked round shiftily, and
      said, &ldquo;I mean no harm by the girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a liar!&rdquo; cried Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a glance of deep malignity, Ross closed with Philip again. It was now
      a struggle of right with wrong as well as nerve with strength. The sun had
      set under the sea, the sally bushes were shivering in the twilight, a
      flight of rooks were screaming overhead. Blows were no more heard. Ross
      gripped Philip in a venomous embrace, and dragged him on to one knee.
      Philip rose, Ross doubled round his waist, pushing him backward, and fell
      heavily on his breast, shouting with the growl of a beast, &ldquo;You'll fight
      me, will you? Get up, get up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip did not rise, and Ross began dragging and lunging at him with
      brutal ferocity, when suddenly, where he bent double, a blow fell on his
      ear from behind, another and another, a hand gripped his shirt collar and
      choked him, and a voice cried, &ldquo;Let go, you brute, let go, let go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ross dropped Philip and swung himself round to return the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the girl. &ldquo;Oh, it's you, is it?&rdquo; he panted. She was like a fury.
      &ldquo;You brute, you beast, you toad,&rdquo; she cried, and then threw herself over
      Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was unconscious. She lifted his head on to her lap, and, lost to all
      shame, to all caution, to all thought but one thought, she kissed him on
      the cheek, on the lips, on the eyes, on the forehead, crying, &ldquo;Philip! oh,
      Philip, Philip!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ross was shuddering beside them. &ldquo;Let me look at him,&rdquo; he faltered, but
      Kate fired back with a glance like an arrow, and said, screaming like a
      sea-gull, &ldquo;If you touch him again I'll strangle you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ross caught a glimpse of Philip's face, and he was terrified. Going to a
      turf pit, he dipped both hands in the dub, and brought some water. &ldquo;Take
      this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for Heaven's sake let me bathe his head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dashed the water on the pallid forehead, and then withdrew his eyes,
      while the girl coaxed Philip back to consciousness with fresh kisses and
      pleading words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he breathing? Feel his heart. Any pulsation? Oh, God!&rdquo; said Ross, &ldquo;it
      wasn't my fault.&rdquo; He looked round with wild eyes; he meditated flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he better yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's it to you, you coward?&rdquo; said Kate, with a burning glance. She went
      on with her work: &ldquo;Come then, dear, come, come now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip opened his eyes in a vacant stare, and rose on his elbow. Then Kate
      fell back from him immediately, and began to cry quietly, being all woman
      now, and her moral courage gone again in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the moral courage of Mr. Ross came back as quickly. He began to sneer
      and to laugh lightly, picked up his riding-whip and strode over to his
      horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; asked Kate, in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it Kate?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of his voice, in that low whisper, Kate's tears came
      streaming down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope youll forgive me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I should have taken your warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wiped his face with the loose sleeve of her dress, and then he
      struggled to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lean on me, Philip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I can walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do take my arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, Kate, I'm strong enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just to please me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ross looked on with jealous rage. His horse, frightened by the fight, had
      twirled round and round till the reins were twisted into a knot about the
      gorse stump, and as he liberated the beast he flogged it back till it flew
      around him. Then he vaulted to the saddle, tugged at the curb, and the
      horse reared. &ldquo;Down,&rdquo; he cried with an oath, and lashed brutally at the
      horse's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Kate, going past him with Philip on her arm, was saying softly,
      &ldquo;Are you feeling better, Philip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Ross, looking on in sulky meditation, sent a harsh laugh out of his
      hot throat, and said, &ldquo;Oh, you can make your mind easy about <i>him</i>,
      if your other man fights for you like that you'll do. Thought you'd have
      three of them, did you? Or perhaps you only wanted me for your decoy? Why
      don't you kiss him now, when he can know it? But he's a beauty to take
      care of you for somebody else. Fighting for the other one, eh? Stuff and
      humbug! Take him home, and the curse of Judas on the brace of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he burst into wild, derisive laughter, flogged his horse on the
      ears and the nose, shouted &ldquo;Down, you brute, down!&rdquo; and shot off at a
      gallop across the open Curragh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip and Kate stood where he had left them till he had disappeared in
      the mist rising off the marshy land, and the hud of his horse's hoofs
      could be no more heard. Their heads were down, and though their arms were
      locked, their faces were turned half aside. There was silence for some
      time. The girl's eyelids quivered; her look was anxious and helpless. Then
      Philip said, &ldquo;Let us go home,&rdquo; and they began to walk together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not another word did they speak. Neither looked into the other's eyes.
      Their entwined arms slackened a little in a passionless asundering, yet
      both felt that they must hold tight or they would fall. It was almost as
      if Ross's parting taunt had uncovered their hearts to each other, and
      revealed to themselves their secret. They were like other children of the
      garden of Eden, driven out and stripped naked.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the bridge they met Cæsar, Grannie, Nancy Joe, and half the inhabitants
      of Sulby, abroad with lanterns in search of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're here,&rdquo; cried Cæsar. &ldquo;You've chastised him, then! You'd bait his
      head off, I'll go bail. And I believe enough you'll be forgiven, sir.
      Yonder blow was almost bitterer than flesh can bear. Before my days of
      grace&mdash;but, praise the Lord for His restraining hand, the very minute
      my anger was up He crippled me in the hip with rheumatics. But what's
      this?&rdquo; holding the lantern over his head; &ldquo;there's blood on your face,
      sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A scratch&mdash;it's nothing,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the women that's in every mischief,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord bless me, aren't the women as good as the men?&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;We're told that man was made a little lower than the
      angels, but about women we're just left to our own conclusions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scripture has nothing to do with Ross Christian, father,&rdquo; said Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord forbid it,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;What can you get from a cat but his
      skin? And doesn't the man come from Christian Ballawhaine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it comes to that, though, haven't we all come from Adam?&rdquo; said
      Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and from Eve too, more's the pity,&rdquo; said Cæsar.

    <h2>
      VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For some time thereafter Philip went no more to Sulby. He had a sufficient
      excuse. His profession made demand of all his energies. When he was not at
      work in Douglas he was expected to be at home with his aunt at Ballure.
      But neither absence nor the lapse of years served to lift him out of the
      reach of temptation. He had one besetting provocation to remembrance&mdash;one
      duty which forbade him to forget Kate&mdash;his pledge to Pete, his office
      as <i>Dooiney Molla</i>. Had he not vowed to keep guard over the girl? He
      must do it. The trust was a sacred one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip found a way out of his difficulty. The post was an impersonal and
      incorruptible go-between, so he wrote frequently. Sometimes he had news to
      send, for, to avoid the espionage of Cæsar, intelligence of Pete came
      through him; occasionally he had love-letters to enclose; now and then he
      had presents to pass on. When such necessity did not arise, he found it
      agreeable to keep up the current of correspondence. At Christmas he sent
      Christmas cards, on Midsummer Day a bunch of moss roses, and even on St.
      Valentine's Day a valentine. All this was in discharge of his duty, and
      everything he did was done in the name of Pete. He persuaded himself that
      he sank his own self absolutely. Having denied his eyes the very sight of
      the girl's face, he stood erect in the belief that he was a true and loyal
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate was less afraid and less ashamed. She took the presents from Pete and
      wore them for Philip. In her secret heart she thought no shame of this.
      The years gave her a larger flow of life, and made out of the bewitching
      girl a splendid woman, brought up to the full estate of maidenly beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      This change wrought by time on her bodily form caused the past to seem to
      her a very long way off. Something had occurred that made her a different
      being. She was like the elder sister of that laughing girl who had known
      Pete. To think of that little sister as having a kind of control over her
      was impossible. Kate never did think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, she held her tongue. Her people were taken in by the episode
      of Ross Christian. According to their view, Kate loved the man and still
      longed for him, and that was why she never talked of Pete. Philip was
      disgusted with her unfaithfulness to his friend, and that was the reason
      of his absence. She never talked of Philip either, but they, on their
      part, talked of him perpetually, and fed her secret passion with his
      praises. Thus for three years these two were like two prisoners in
      neighbouring cells, very close and yet very far apart, able to hear each
      other's voices, yet never to see each other's faces, yearning to come
      together and to touch, but unable to do so because of the wall that stood
      between.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the fight, Cæsar had removed her from all duties of the inn, and one
      day in the spring she was in the gable house peeling rushes to make tallow
      candles when Kelly, the postman, passed by the porch, where Nancy Joe was
      cleaning the candle-irons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard the newses, Nancy?&rdquo; said Kelly. &ldquo;Mr. Philip Christian is let off
      two years' time and called to the bar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy looked grave. &ldquo;I'm sure the young gentleman is that quiet and
      studdy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What are they doing on him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only making him a full advocate, woman,&rdquo; said Kelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say?&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He passed his examination before the Govenar's man yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, there now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took the letter to Ballure this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's like you would, Mr. Kelly. That's the boy for you. I'm always saying
      it. 'Deed I am, though, but there's ones here that won't have it at all,
      at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Kate, you mane? We know the raison. He's lumps in her porridge,
      woman. Good-day to you, Nancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's doing a nice day enough, Mr. Kelly,&rdquo; said Nancy, and the
      postman passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate came gliding out with a brush in her hand. &ldquo;What was the postman
      saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&mdash;Mr.&mdash;Philip&mdash;Christian&mdash;has been passing&mdash;for
      an advocate,&rdquo; said Nancy deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate's eyes glistened, and her lips quivered with delight; but she only
      said, with an air of indifference, &ldquo;Was that all his news, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All? D'ye say all?&rdquo; said Nancy, digging away at the candle-irons. &ldquo;Listen
      to the girl! And him that good to her while her promist man's away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate shelled her rush, and said, with a sigh and a sly look, &ldquo;I'm afraid
      you think a deal too much of him, Nancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll be making mends,&rdquo; said Nancy, &ldquo;for some that's thinking a dale
      too little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm quite at a loss to know what you see in him,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you don't say!&rdquo; said Nancy with scorching irony. Then, banging her
      irons, she added, &ldquo;I'm not much of a woman for a man myself. They're only
      poor helpless creatures anyway, and I don't approve of them. But if I was
      for putting up with one of the sort, he wouldn't have legs and arms like a
      dolly, and a face like curds and whey, and coat and trousers that loud you
      can hear them coming up the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this parting shot at Ross Christian, Nancy flung into the house,
      thinking she had given Kate a dressing that she would never forget. Kate
      was radiant. Such abuse was honey on her lips, such scoldings were
      joy-bells in her ears. She took silent delight in provoking these attacks.
      They served her turn both ways, bringing her delicious joy at the praise
      of Philip, and at the same time preserving her secret.

    <h2>
      VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Latter that day Cæsar came in from the mill with the startling
      intelligence that Philip was riding up on the highroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness mercy!&rdquo; cried Nancy, and she fled away to wash her face. Grannie
      with a turn of the hand settled her cap, and smoothed her grey hair under
      it. Kate herself had disappeared like a flash of light; but as Philip
      dismounted at the gate, looking taller, and older, and paler, and more
      serious, but raising his cap from his fair head and smiling a smile like
      sunshine, she was coming leisurely out of the porch with a bewitching hat
      over her wavy black hair and a hand-basket over her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a little start of surprise and recognition, a short catch
      of quick breath and nervous salutations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going round to the nests,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I suppose you'll step in to see
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time enough for that,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;May I help you with the eggs first?
      Besides, I've something to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it that you're 'admitted?'&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's nothing,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;Only the A B C, you know. Getting ready to
      begin, so to speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked round to the stackyard, and he tied up his horse and gave it
      hay. Then, while they poked about for eggs on hands and knees among the
      straw, under the stacks and between the bushes, she said she hoped he
      would have success, and he answered that success was more than a hope to
      him now&mdash;it was a sort of superstition. She did not understand this,
      but looked up at him from all fours with brightening eyes, and said, &ldquo;What
      a glorious thing it is to be a man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;And yet I remember somebody who said she wasn't
      sorry to be a girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I?&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;But that was long ago. And <i>I</i> remember somebody
      else who pretended he was glad I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was long ago too,&rdquo; said Philip, and both laughed nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What strange things girls are&mdash;and boys!&rdquo; said Kate with a matronly
      sigh, burying her face in a nest where a hen was clucking and two downy
      chicks were peeping from her wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went through to the orchard, where the trees were breaking into eager
      blossoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've another letter for you from Pete,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So?&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you read it?&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's yours; surely a girl doesn't want anybody else&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but you're different, though; you know everything&mdash;and besides&mdash;read
      it aloud, Philip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With her basket of eggs on one arm, and the other hand on the outstretched
      arm of an apple-tree, she waited while he read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Kitty,&mdash;How's yourself, darling, and how's Philip, and how's
      Grannie? I'm getting on tremendous. They're calling me Captain now&mdash;Capt'n
      Pete. Sort of overseer at the Diamond Mines outside Kimberley. Regular
      gentleman's life and no mistake. Nothing to do but sit under a monstrous
      big umbrella, with a paper in your fist, like a chairman, while twenty
      Kaffirs do the work. Just a bit of a tussle now and then to keep you from
      dropping off. When a Kaffir turns up a diamond, you grab it, and mark it
      on the time-sheet against his name. They've got their own outlandish ones,
      but we always christen them ourselves&mdash;Sixpence, Seven Waistcoats,
      Shoulder-of-Mutton, Twopenny Trotter&mdash;anything you like. When a
      Kaffir strikes a diamond, he gets a commission, and so does his overseer.
      I'm afraid I'm going to be getting terrible rich soon. Tell the old man
      I'll be buying that har-monia yet. They are a knowing lot, though, and if
      they can get up a dust to smuggle a stone when you're not looking, they
      will. Then they sell it to the blackleg Boers, and you've got to raise
      your voice like an advocate to get it back somehow. But the Boers can't do
      no harm to you with their fists at all&mdash;it's playing. They're a dirty
      lot, wonderful straight like some of the lazy Manx ones, especially Black
      Tom. When they see us down at the river washing, they say, 'What dirty
      people the English must be if they have to wash themselves three times a
      day&mdash;we only do it once a week.' When a Kaffir steals a stone we
      usually court-martial him, but I don't hold with it, as the floggers on
      the compound can't be trusted; so I always lick my own niggers, being more
      kinder, and if anybody does anything against me, they lynch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate made a little patient sigh and turned away her head, while Philip, in
      a halting voice, went on&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling Kitty, I am longing mortal for a sight of your sweet face. When
      the night comes, and I'll be lying in the huts&mdash;boards on the ground,
      and good canvas, and everything comfortable&mdash;says I to the boys,
      'Shut your faces, men, and let a poor chap sleep;' but they never twig the
      darkness of my meaning. I'll only be wanting a bit of quiet for thinking
      of.... with the stars atwinkling down.... She's looking at that one....
      Shine on my angel....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Kate,&rdquo; faltered Philip, &ldquo;I can't&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to me, then,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was tugging with her trembling hand at the arm of the apple-tree, and
      the white blossom was raining over her from the rowels of the thin boughs
      overhead, like silver fish falling from the herring-net. Taking the
      letter, she glanced over the close&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;darlin Kirry how is the mackral this saison and is the millin doing
      middling and I wonder is the hens all layin and is the grace gone out of
      the mares leg yet and how is the owl man and is he still playin hang with
      the texes. Theer is a big chap heer that is strait like him he hath
      swallowed the owl Book and cant help bring it up agen but dear Kirry no
      more at present i axpect to be Home sune bogh, to see u all tho I dont no
      azactly With luv your luving swateart peat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had finished the letter, she turned it over in her fingers, and
      gave another patient little sigh. &ldquo;You didn't read it as it was spelled,
      Philip,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What odds if the spelling is uncertain when the love is as sure as that?&rdquo;
       said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he write it himself, think you?&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He signed it, anyway, and no doubt indited it too; but perhaps one of the
      Gills boys held the pen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She coloured a little, slipped the letter down her dress into her pocket,
      and looked ashamed.

    </div>
    <h2>
      VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      This shame at Pete's letter tormented Philip, and he stayed away again.
      His absence stimulated Kate and made Philip himself ashamed. She was vexed
      with him that he did not see that all this matter of Pete was foolishness.
      It was absurd to think of a girl marrying a man whom she had known when he
      was a boy. But Philip was trying to keep the bond sacred, and so she made
      her terms with it. She used Pete as a link to hold Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the lapse of some months, in which Philip had not been seen at
      Sulby, she wrote him a letter. It was to say how anxious she had been at
      the length of time since she had last heard from Pete, and to ask if he
      had any news to relieve her fears. The poor little lie was written in a
      trembling hand which shook honestly enough, but from the torment of other
      feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip answered the letter in person. Something had been speaking to him
      day and night, like the humming of a top, finding him pretexts on which to
      go; but now he had to make excuses for staying so long away. It was
      evening. Kate was milking, and he went out to her in the cowhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We began to think we were to see no more of you,&rdquo; she said, over the
      rattle of the milk in the pail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've&mdash;I've been ill,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rattle died to a thin hiss. &ldquo;Very ill?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no&mdash;not seriously,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never once thought of that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Something ought to have told
      me. I've been reproaching you, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip felt shame of his subterfuge, but yet more ashamed of the truth; so
      he leaned against the door and watched in silence. The smell of hay
      floated down from the loft, and the odour of the cow's breath came in
      gusts as she turned her face about. Kate sat on the milking-stool close by
      the ewer, and her head, on which she wore a sun-bonnet, she leaned against
      the cow's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No news of Pete, then? No?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate dug her head deeper in the cow, and muttered, &ldquo;Dear Pete! So simple,
      so natural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So good-hearted, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And such a manly fellow&mdash;any girl might like him,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, yes,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence again, and two pigs which had been snoring on the manure
      heap outside began to snort their way home. Kate turned her head so that
      the crown of the sun-bonnet was toward Phillip, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! Can there be anything so terrible as marrying somebody you
      don't care for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing so bad,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mouth of the sun-bonnet came round. &ldquo;Yes, there's one thing worse,
      Philip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not having married somebody you do,&rdquo; said Kate, and the milk rattled like
      hail.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the straw behind. Kate there was a tailless Manx cat with three tailed
      kittens, and Philip began to play with them. Being back to back with Kate,
      he could keep his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This old Horney is terrible for switching,&rdquo; said Kate, over her shoulder.
      &ldquo;Don't you think you could hold her tail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That brought them face to face again. &ldquo;It's so sweet to have some one to
      talk to about Pete,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how I could bear his long absence but for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you longing so much, Kate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not longing&mdash;not to say longing. Only you can't think what
      it is to be... have you never been yourself, Philip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; &ldquo;Hold it tight... in love? No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Philip, speaking at the crown of the sun-bonnet. &ldquo;Ha! ha!
      well, not properly perhaps&mdash;I don't&mdash;I can hardly say, Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! You've let it go, after all, and she's covered me with the milk!
      But I'm finished, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate was suddenly radiant. She kissed Horney, and hugged her calf in the
      adjoining stall; and as they crossed the haggard, Philip carrying the
      pail, she scattered great handfuls of oats to a cock and his two hens as
      they cackled their way to roost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be sure to come again soon, Philip, eh? It's so sweet to have some
      one to remind me of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but Pete's name choked her now. &ldquo;Not
      that I'm likely to forget him&mdash;now is that likely? But it's such a
      weary time to be left alone, and a girl gets longing. Did I now? Give me
      the milk, then. Did I say I wasn't? Well, you can't expect a girl to be <i>always</i>
      reasonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you had better go now&mdash;good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip went away in pain, yet in delight, with a delicious thrill, and a
      sense of stifling hypocrisy. He had felt like a fool. Kate must have
      thought him one. But better she should think him a fool than a traitor. It
      was all his fault. Only for him the girl would have been walled round by
      her love for Pete. He would come no more.

    </div>
    <h2>
      IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Philip held to his resolution for three months, and grew thin and pale.
      Then another letter came from Pete&mdash;a letter for himself, and he
      wondered what to do with it. To send it by post, pretending to be ill
      again, would be hypocrisy he could not support. He took it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family were all at home. Nancy had just finished a noisy churning, and
      Kate was in the dairy, weighing the butter into pounds and stamping it.
      Philip read the letter in a loud voice to the old people in the kitchen,
      and the soft thumping and watery swishing ceased in the damp place
      adjoining. Pete was in high feather. He had made a mortal lot of money
      lately, and was for coming home quickly. Couldn't say exactly when, for
      some rascally blackleg Boers, who had been corrupting his Kaffirs and
      slipped up country with a pile of stones, had first to be followed and
      caught. The job wouldn't take long though, and they might expect to see
      him back within a twelvemonth, with enough in his pocket to drive away the
      devil and the coroner anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bould fellow!&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, deed on Pete!&rdquo; said Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, if it wasn't for that Ross&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip went into the dairy, where Kate was now skimming the cream of the
      last night's milking. He was sorry there was nothing but a message for her
      this time. Had she answered Pete's former letters? No, she had not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be writing soon, I suppose,&rdquo; she said, blowing the yellow surface.
      &ldquo;But I wish&mdash;<i>puff</i>&mdash;I could have something to tell him&mdash;<i>puff,
      puff</i>&mdash;about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About me, Kate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something sweet, I mean &ldquo;&mdash;<i>puff, puff, puff</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shot a sly look upward. &ldquo;Aren't you sure yet? Can't say still? Not
      properly? No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip pretended not to understand. Kate's laugh echoed in the empty cream
      tins. &ldquo;How you want people to say things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, really&mdash;&rdquo; began Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've always heard that the girls of Douglas are so beautiful. You must
      see so many now. Oh, it would be delicious to write a long story to Pete.
      Where you met&mdash;in church, naturally. What she's like&mdash;fair, of
      course. And&mdash;and all about it, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a story you will never tell to Pete, Kate,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, never,&rdquo; said Kate quite as light, and this being just what she wished
      to hear, she added mournfully. &ldquo;Don't say that, though. You can't think
      what pleasure you are denying me, and yourself, too. Take some poor girl
      to your heart, Philip. You don't know how happy it will make you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are <i>you</i> so happy, then, Kate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate laughed merrily. &ldquo;Why, what do <i>you</i> think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old Pete&mdash;how happy <i>he</i> should be,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate began to hate the very name of Pete. She grew angry with Philip also.
      Why couldn't he guess? Concealment was eating her heart out. The next time
      she saw Philip, he passed her in the market-place on the market-day, as
      she stood by the tipped-up gig, selling her butter. There was a chatter of
      girls all round as he bowed and went on. This vexed her, and she sold out
      at a penny a pound less, got the horse from the &ldquo;Saddle,&rdquo; and drove home
      early.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way to Sulby she overtook Philip and drew up. He was walking to
      Kirk Michael to visit the old Deemster, who was ill. Would he not take a
      lift? He hesitated, half declined, and then got into the gig. As she
      settled herself comfortably after this change, he trod on the edge of her
      dress. At that he drew quickly away as if he had trodden on her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, but she was vexed; and when he got down at &ldquo;The Manx Fairy,&rdquo;
       saying he might call on his way back in the evening, she had no doubt
      Grannie would be glad to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls of the market-place were standing by the mill-pond, work done,
      and arms crossed under their aprons, twittering like the pairing birds
      about them in the trees, when Philip returned home by Sulby. He saw Kate
      coming down the glen road, driving two heifers with a cushag for switch
      and flashing its gold at them in the horizontal gleams of sunset. She had
      recovered her good-humour, and was swinging along, singing merry snatches
      as she came&mdash;all life, all girlish blood and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pretended not to see him until they were abreast, and the heifers were
      going into the yard. Then she said, &ldquo;I've written and told him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you say you are a confirmed old bachelor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That <i>I</i> say so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and that <i>I</i> say you are so distant with a girl that I don't
      believe you have a heart at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; and that he couldn't have left anybody better to look after me all
      these years, because you haven't eyes or ears or a thought for any living
      creature except himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've never written that to Pete?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't I, though?&rdquo; said Kate, and she tripped off on tiptoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tripped after her. She ran into the yard. He ran also. She opened the
      gate of the orchard, slipped through, and made for the door of the dairy,
      and there he caught her by the waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, you rogue! Say no, say no!&rdquo; he panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she whispered, turning up her lips for a kiss.

    <h2>
      X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Grannie saw nothing of Philip that night. He went home tingling with
      pleasure, and yet overwhelmed with shame. Sometimes he told himself that
      he was no better than a Judas, and sometimes that Pete might never come
      back. The second thought rose oftenest. It crossed his mind like a ghostly
      gleam. He half wished to believe it. When he counted up the odds against
      Pete's return, his pulse beat quick. Then he hated himself. He was in
      torment. But under his distracted heart there was a little chick of
      frightened joy, like a young cuckoo hatched in a wagtail's nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      After many days, in which no further news had come from Pete, Kate
      received this brief letter from Philip:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming to see you this evening. Have something of grave importance
      to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was afternoon, and Kate ran upstairs, hurried on her best frock, and
      came down to help Nancy to gather apples in the orchard. Black Tom was
      there, new thatching the back of the house, and Cæsar was making sugganes
      (straw rope) for him with a twister. There was a soft feel of autumn in
      the air, pigeons were cooing in the ledges of the mill-house gable, and
      everything was luminous and tranquil. Kate had climbed to the fork of a
      tree, and was throwing apples into Nancy's apron, when the orchard gate
      clicked, and she uttered a little cry of joy unawares as Philip entered.
      To cover this, she pretended to be falling, and he ran to help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's nothing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thought the bough was breaking. So it's
      you!&rdquo; Then, in a clear voice, &ldquo;Is your apron full, Nancy? Yes? Bring
      another basket, then; the white one with the handles. Did you come Laxey
      way by the coach? Bode over, eh? Nancy, do you really think we'll have
      sugar enough for all these Keswicks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evenin', Mr. Christian, sir,&rdquo; said Cæsar. And Black Tom, from the
      ladder on the roof, nodded his wide straw brim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thatching afresh, Mr. Cregeen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Covering it up, sir; covering it up. May the Lord cover our sins up
      likewise, or how shall we cover ourselves from His avenging wrath?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How vexing!&rdquo; said Kate, from the tree. &ldquo;Half of them get bruised, and
      will be good for nothing but preserving. They drop at the first touch&mdash;so
      ripe, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May we all be ripe for the great gathering, and good for preserving,
      too,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;Look at that big one, now&mdash;knotted like a
      blacksmith's muscles, but it'll go rotten as fast as the least lil one of
      the lot. It's taiching us a lesson, sir, that we all do fall&mdash;big
      mountains as aisy as lil cocks. This world is changeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was not listening, but looking up at Kate, with a face of
      half-frightened tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I was afraid you must be ill again&mdash;your
      apron, Nancy&mdash;that was foolish, wasn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; <i>I</i> have been well enough,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate looked at him. &ldquo;Is it somebody else?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I got your letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I help?&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;What is it? I'm sure there's something,&rdquo; said
      Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set your foot here,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me down, I feel giddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slowly, then. Hold by this one. Give me your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their fingers touched, and communicated fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you tell me?&rdquo; she said, with a passionate tightening of his
      hand. &ldquo;It's bad news, isn't it? Are you going away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody who went away will never come back,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it&mdash;Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Pete is gone,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her throat fluttered. &ldquo;Gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dead,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tottered, but drew herself up quickly. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let me make
      sure. Is there no mistake? Is it true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can bear the truth now&mdash;but afterwards&mdash;to-night&mdash;tomorrow&mdash;in
      the morning it might kill me if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete is dead, Kate; he died at Kimberley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She burst into a wild fit of hysterical weeping, and buried her face his
      his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his arms about her, thinking to soothe her. &ldquo;There! be brave! Hold
      yourself firm. It's a terrible blow. I was too sudden. My poor girl. My
      brave girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clung to him like a terrified child; the tears came from under her
      eyelids tightly closed; the flood-gates of four years' reserve went down
      in a moment, and she kissed him on the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, throbbing with bliss and a blessed relief from four years hypocrisy
      and treason, he kissed her back, and they smiled through their tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Pete! Poor Pete! Poor Pete!

    <h2>
      XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the sound of Kate's crying, Cæsar had thrown away the twister and come
      close to listen, and Black Tom had dropped from the thatch. Nancy ran back
      with the basket, and Grannie came hurrying from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar lifted both hands solemnly. &ldquo;Now, you that are women, control
      yourselves,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and listen while I spake. Peter Quilliam's dead in
      Kimberley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness mercy!&rdquo; cried Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord alive!&rdquo; cried Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the two women went indoors, threw their aprons over their heads, and
      rocked themselves in their seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw boy veen! boy veen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate came tottering in, ghostly white, and the women fell to comforting
      her, thereby making more tumult with their soothing moans than Kate with
      her crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chut'! Put a good face on it, woman,&rdquo; said Black Tom. &ldquo;A whippa of a girl
      like you will be getting another soon, and singing, 'Hail, Smiling Morn!'
      with the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shame on you, man. Are you as drunk as Mackillya?&rdquo; cried Nancy. &ldquo;Your own
      grandson, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never another for Kate, anyway,&rdquo; wept Grannie. &ldquo;Aw boy veen, aw boy
      veen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe he had another himself, who knows?&rdquo; said Black Tom. &ldquo;Out of sight
      out of mind, and these sailor lads have a rag on lots of bushes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate was helped to her room upstairs, Philip sat down in the kitchen, the
      news spread like a curragh fire, and the barroom was full in five minutes.
      In the midst of all stood Cæsar, solemn and expansive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He turned his herring yonder night when he left goodbye to the four of
      us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My father did the same the night he was lost running rum
      for Whitehaven, and I've never seen a man do it and live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's forgot at you father,&rdquo; wept Grannie. &ldquo;It was Mr. Philip that turned
      it. Aw boy veen! boy veen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could that be, mother?&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;Mr. Philip isn't dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Grannie heard no more. She was busy with the consolations of
      half-a-dozen women who were gathered around her. &ldquo;I dreamt it the night he
      sailed. I heard a cry, most terrible, I did. 'Father,' says I, 'what's
      that?' It was the same as if I had seen the poor boy coming to his end
      un-timeously. And I didn't get a wink on the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he has gone to the rest that remaineth,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;The grass
      perisheth, and the worm devoureth, and well all be in heaven with him
      soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid, father; don't talk of such dreadful things,&rdquo; said Grannie,
      napping her apron. &ldquo;Do you say his mother, ma'am? Is she in life? No, but
      under the sod, I don't know the years. Information of the lungs, poor
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've known him since I was a slip of a boy,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;It was whip-top
      time&mdash;no, it was peg-top time&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him the morning he sailed,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;I was standing <i>so</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Christian saw him last,&rdquo; moaned Grannie, and the people in the
      bar-room peered through at Philip with awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt like a father for the lad myself,&rdquo; said Cæsar, &ldquo;he was always my
      white-headed boy, and I stuck to him with life. He desarved it, too. Maybe
      his birth was a bit mischancy, but what's the ould saying, 'Don't tell me
      what I was, tell me what I am.' And Pete was that civil with the tongue&mdash;a
      civiller young man never was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Black Tom <i>tsht</i> and spat. &ldquo;Why, you were shouting out of mercy at
      the lad, and knocking him about like putty. He wouldn't get lave to live
      with you, and that's why he went away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're bad to forget, Thomas&mdash;I've always noticed it,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be putting the bell about, and praiching his funeral, eh, Cæsar?&rdquo;
       said somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Deed, yes, man, Sabbath first,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's impossible, father,&rdquo; said Grannie. &ldquo;How's the girl to have her
      black ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sunday week, then, or Sunday fortnight, or the Sunday after the Melliah
      (harvest-home),&rdquo; said Cæsar; &ldquo;the crops are waiting for saving, but a dead
      man is past it. Oh, I'll be faithful, I'll give it them straight, it's a
      time for spaking like a dying man to dying men; I'll take a tex' that'll
      be a lesson and a warning, 'Ho, every one that thirsteth&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Black Tom <i>tsht</i> and spat again. &ldquo;I wouldn't, Cæsar; they'll think
      you're going to trate them,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was asked for particulars, and he brought out a letter. Jonaique
      Jelly, John the Clerk, and Johnny the Constable had come in by this time.
      &ldquo;Read it, Jonaique,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A clane pipe first,&rdquo; said Black Tom. &ldquo;Aren't you smook-ing on it, Cæsar?
      And isn't there a croppa of rum anywhere? No! Not so much as a plate of
      crackers and a drop of tay going? Is it to be a totaller's funeral then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is no time for feasting to the refreshment of our carnal bodies,&rdquo;
       said Cæsar severely. &ldquo;It's a time for praise and prayer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll pud up a word or dwo,&rdquo; said the Constable meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Masther Niplightly,&rdquo; said Cæsar, &ldquo;don't be too ready to show your gift.
      It's vanity. I'll engage in prayer myself.&rdquo; And Cæsar offered praise for
      all departed in faith and fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cæsar is nod a man of a liberal spirit, bud he is powerful in prayer,
      dough,&rdquo; whispered the Constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn't a prodigal son, if that's what you mane,&rdquo; said Black Tom. &ldquo;Never
      seen him shouting after anybody with a pint, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for the letter, Jonaique,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was from one of the Gills' boys who had sailed with Pete, and hitherto
      served as his letter-writer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Respected Sir,'&rdquo; read Jonaique, &ldquo;'with pain and sorrow I write these few
      lines, to tell you of poor Peter Quilliam&mdash;&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw boy veen, boy veen!&rdquo; broke in Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Knowing you were his friend in the old island, and the one he talked of
      mostly, except the girl&mdash;&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boy ve&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'He made good money out here, at the diamond mines&mdash;&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never a yellow sovereign he sent to me, then,&rdquo; said Black Tom, &ldquo;nor the
      full of your fist of ha'pence either. What's the use of getting
      grand-childers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar waved his hand. &ldquo;Go on, Jonaique. It's bad when the deceitfulness of
      riches is getting the better of a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was I? Oh, 'good money &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;' 'Yet he was never for
      taking joy in it&mdash;&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More money, more cares,&rdquo; muttered Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But talking and talking, and scheming for ever, for coming home.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! home is a full cup,&rdquo; moaned Grannie. &ldquo;It was a show the way that lad
      was fond of it. 'Give me a plate of mate, bolstered with cabbage, and what
      do I care for their buns and sarves, Grannie,' says he. Aw, boy veen, boy
      bogh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does the nightingale care for a golden cage when he can get a twig?&rdquo;
       said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the boy's chest home yet?&rdquo; asked John the Clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's something about it here,&rdquo; said Jonaique, &ldquo;if people would only
      let a man get on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's mine,&rdquo; said Black Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll think of that by-and-bye,&rdquo; said Cæsar, waving his hand to Jonaique.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'He had packed his chest for going, when four blacklegs, who had been
      hanging round the compound, tempting and plaguing the Kaffirs, made off
      with a bag of stones. Desperate gang, too; so nobody was running to be
      sent after them. But poor Peter, being always a bit bull-necked, was up to
      the office in a jiffy, and Might he go? And off in chase in the everin'
      with the twenty Kaffirs of his own company to help him&mdash;not much of a
      lot neither, and suspected of dealing diamonds with the blacklegs times;
      but Peter always swore their love for him was getting thicker and stronger
      every day like sour cream. &ldquo;The captain's love has been their theme, and
      shall be till they die,&rdquo; said Peter.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He drank up the Word like a thirsty land the rain,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;Peter
      Quilliam and I had mortal joy of each other. 'Good-bye, father,' says he,
      and he was shaking me by the hand ter'ble. But go on, Jonaique.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That was four months ago, and a fortnight since eight of his Kaffirs
      came back.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw dear!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord-a-massy!&rdquo; &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'They overtook the blacklegs far up country, and Peter tackled them. But
      they had Winchester repeaters, and Peter's boys didn't know the muzzle of
      a gun from the neck of a gin-bottle. So the big man of the gang cocked his
      piece at Peter, and shouted at him like a high bailiff, &ldquo;You'd better go
      back the way you came.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not immajetly,&rdquo; said Peter, and stretched him.
      Then there was smoke like a smithy on hooping-day, and &ldquo;To your heels,
      boys,&rdquo; shouted Peter. And if the boys couldn't equal Peter with their
      hands, they could bate him with their toes, and the last they heard of him
      he was racing behind them with the shots of the blacklegs behind him, and
      shouting mortal, &ldquo;Oh, oh! All up! I'm done! Home and tell, boys! Oh,
      oh."'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy. When I fall I shall arise. Selah,&rdquo;
       said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid the tumult of moans which followed the reading, Philip, sitting with
      head on his hand by the ingle, grew hot and cold with the thought that
      after all there was no actual certainty that Pete was dead. Nobody had
      seen him die, nobody had buried him; the story of the returned Kaffirs
      might be a lie to cover their desertion of Pete, their betrayal of him, or
      their secret league with the thieving Boers. At one awful moment Philip
      asked himself how he had ever believed the letter. Perhaps he had <i>wanted</i>
      to believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy Joe touched him on the shoulder. &ldquo;Kate is waiting for a word with
      you alone, sir,&rdquo; she said, and Philip crossed the kitchen into the little
      parlour beyond, chill with china and bowls of sea-eggs and stuffed
      sea-birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's feeling it bad,&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never been the same since Pete went to the Cape,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know for sure what good lads are going to it for,&rdquo; moaned
      Grannie. &ldquo;And calling it Good Hope of all names! Died of a bullet in his
      head, too, aw dear, aw dear! Discussion of the brain it's like. And look
      at them black-heads too, as naked as my hand, I'll go bail. I hate the
      nasty dirts! Cæsar may talk of one flesh and brethren and all to that, but
      for my part I'm not used of black brothers, and as for black angels in
      heaven, it's ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you're all done talking I'll finish the letter,&rdquo; said Jonaique.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can't help it, Mr. Jelly, the women can't help it,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Respected Sir, I must now close, but we are strapping up the chest of
      the deceased, just as he left it, and sending it to catch the steamer, the
      <i>Johannesburg</i>, leaving Cape Town Wednesday fortnight&mdash;&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm! Johannesburg. I'll meet her at the quay&mdash;it's my duty to meet
      her,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'll board her in the bay,&rdquo; shouted Black Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thomas Quilliam,&rdquo; said Cæsar, &ldquo;it's borne in on my spirit that the devil
      of greed is let loose on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cæsar Cregeen, don't make a nose of wax of me,&rdquo; bawled Tom, &ldquo;and don't
      think because you're praiching a bit that religion is going to die with
      you. Your head's swelling tre-menjous, and-you won't be able to sleep soon
      without somebody to tickle your feet. You'll be forgiving sins next, and
      taking money for absolution, and these ones will be making a pope of you
      and paying you pence. Pope Cæsar, the publican, in his chapel hat and
      white choker! But that chiss is mine, and if there's law in the land I'll
      have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that Black Tom swept out of the house, and Cæsar wiped his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use smoothing a thistle, Mr. Cregeen,&rdquo; said Jonaique soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've a conscience void of offence.&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;I can only follow the
      spirit's leading. But when Belial&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by a most mournful cry of &ldquo;Look here! Aw, look, then,
      look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy was coming out of the back-kitchen with something between the tips
      of her fingers. It was a pair of old shoes, covered with dirt and cobwebs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These were his wearing boots,&rdquo; she said, and she put them on the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear heart, yes, the very ones,&rdquo; said Grannie. &ldquo;Poor boy, they'd move a
      heart of stone to see them. Something to remember him by, anyway. Many a
      mile his feet walked in them; but they're resting now in Abraham's bosom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Cæsar's voice rose loud over the doleful tones around the counter.
      &ldquo;'Vital Spark of Heavenly Flame'&mdash;raise it, Mr. Niplightly. Pity we
      haven't Peter and his fiddle here&mdash;he played with life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can'd sing to-day, having a cold, bud I'll whisle id,&rdquo; said the
      Constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pitch it in altoes, then,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;I'm a bit of a base myself, but
      not near so base as Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile a little drama of serious interest was going on upstairs. There
      sat Kate before the looking-glass, with flushed cheeks and quivering
      mouth. The low drone of many voices came to her through the floor. Then a
      dull silence and one voice, and Nancy Joe coming and going between the
      kitchen and bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they doing now, Nancy?&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First one's praying, and then another's praying,&rdquo; said Nancy.
      &ldquo;Lord-a-massy, thinks I, it'll be my turn next, and what'll I say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Mr. Christian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone into the parlour. I whispered him you wanted him alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never said that, Nancy,&rdquo; said Kate, at Nancy's reflection in the
      glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it popped out,&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate went down, with a look of softened sorrow, and Philip, without
      lifting his eyes, began bemoaning Pete. They would never know his like&mdash;so
      simple, so true, so brave; never, never.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was fighting against his shame at first seeing the girl after that
      kiss, which seemed to him now like treason at the mouth of a grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, with the magic of a woman's art, Kate consoled him. He had one great
      comfort&mdash;he had been a loyal friend; such fidelity, such constancy,
      such affection, forgetting the difference of place, of education&mdash;everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip looked up at last, and there was the lovely face with its beaming
      eyes. He turned to go, and she said, softly, &ldquo;How we shall miss you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't expect to see you so often now&mdash;now that you've not the
      same reason for coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be here on Sunday,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don't intend to desert us yet&mdash;not just yet, Philip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-night! Not that way&mdash;not by the porch. Good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Philip went down the road in the darkness, he heard the words of the
      hymn that was being sung inside:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy glory why didst Thou enshrine In such a clod of earth as mine, And
      wrap Thee in my clay.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At that moment day was breaking over the plains of the Transvaal. The bare
      Veldt was opening out as the darkness receded, depth on depth, like the
      surface of an unbroken sea. Not a bush, not a path, only a few log-houses
      at long distances and wooden beacons like gibbets to define the Boer
      farms. No sound in the transparent air, no cloud in the unveiling sky;
      just the night creeping off in silence as if in fear of awakening the
      sleeping morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the soulless immensity a covered waggon toiled along with four
      horses rattling their link chains, and a lad sideways on the shaft
      dangling his legs, twiddling the rope reins and whistling. Inside the
      waggon, under a little window with its bit of muslin curtain, a man lay in
      the agony of a bullet-wound in his side, and an old Boer and a woman stood
      beside him. He was lying hard on the place of his pain and rambling in
      delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, boys? Don't you see them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what, my lad?&rdquo; said the Boer simply, and he looked through the waggon
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the head-gear of the mines. Look! the iron roofs are glittering.
      And yonder's the mine tailings. We'll be back in a jiffy. A taste of the
      whip, boys, and away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Untouched by visions, the old Boer could see nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he see, wife, think you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can he see, stupid, with his face in the pillow like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the rushing of blood in his ears the sick man called out again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen! Don't you hear it? That's the noise of the batteries. Whip up,
      and away! Away!&rdquo; and he tore at the fringe of the blanket covering him
      with his unconscious fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy! he's eager to get to the coast But will he live to cover
      another morgen, think you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows, Jan&mdash;God only knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the Veldt was very wide, and the sea and its ships were far away, and
      over the weary stretch of grass, and rock, and sand, there was nothing on
      the horizon between desolate land and dominating sky but a waste looking
      like a chaos of purple and green, where no bird ever sang and no man ever
      lived, and God Himself was not.

    <h2>
      XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She loves me! She loves me! She loves me!&rdquo; The words sang in Philip's
      ears like a sweet tune half the way back to Ballure. Then he began to
      pluck at the brambles by the wayside, to wound his hand by snatching at
      the gorse, and to despise himself for being glad when he should have been
      in grief. Still, he was sure of it; there was no making any less of it.
      She loved him, he was free to love her, there need be no hypocrisy and no
      self-denial; so he wiped the blood from his fingers, and crept into the
      blue room of Auntie Nan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady, in a dainty cap with flying streamers, was sitting by the
      fireside spinning. She had heard the news of Pete as Philip passed through
      to Sulby, and was now wondering if it was not her duty to acquaint Uncle
      Peter. The sweet and natty old gentlewoman, brought up in the odour of
      gentility, was thinking on the lines of poor Bridget, Black Tom when dying
      under the bare scraas, that a man's son was his son in spite of law or
      devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      She decided against telling the Ballawhaine by remembering an incident in
      the life of his father. It was about Philip's father, too; so Philip
      stretched his legs from the sofa towards the hearth, and listened to the
      old Auntie's voice over the whirr of her wheel, with another voice&mdash;a
      younger voice, an unheard voice&mdash;breaking: in at the back of his ears
      when the wheel stopped, and a sweet undersong inside of him always,
      saying, &ldquo;Be sensible; there is no disloyalty; Pete is dead. Poor Pete!
      Poor old Pete!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though he had cast your father off, Philip, for threatening to make your
      mother his wife, he never believed there was a parson on the island would
      dare to marry them against his wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; and when Uncle Peter came in at dinner-time a week after and said,
      'It's all over,' he said, 'No, sir, no,' and threw down his spoon in the
      plate, and the hot broth splashed on my hand, I remember. But Peter said,
      'It's past praying for, sir,' and then grandfather cried, 'No, I tell you
      no.' 'But I tell you yes, sir,' said Peter. 'Maughold Church yesterday
      morning before service.' Then grandfather lost himself, and called Peter
      'Liar,' and cried that your father couldn't do it. 'And, besides, he's my
      own son after all, and would not,' said grandfather. But I could see that
      he believed what Uncle Peter had told him, and, when Peter began to cry,
      he said, 'Forgive me, my boy; I'm your father for all, and I've a right to
      your forgiveness.' All the same, he wouldn't be satisfied until he had
      seen the register, and I had to go with him to the church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old grandfather!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The vicar in those days was a little dotty man named Kissack, and it was
      the joy of his life to be always crushing and stifling somebody, because
      somebody was always depriving him of his rights or something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember him&mdash;the Cockatoo. His favourite text was, 'Jesus said,
      then follow Me,' only the people declared he always wanted to go first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shocking, Philip. It was evening when we drove up to Maughold, and the
      little parson was by the Cross, ordering somebody with a cane. 'I am told
      you married my son yesterday; is it true?' said grandfather. 'Quite true,'
      said the vicar. 'By banns or special license?' grandfather asked.
      'License, of course,' the vicar answered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curt enough, any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Show me the register,' said grandfather, and his face twitched and his
      voice was thick. 'Can't you believe me?' said the vicar. 'The register,'
      said grandfather. Then the vicar turned the key in the church door and
      strutted up the aisle, humming something. I tried to keep grandfather back
      even then. 'What's the use?' I said, for I knew he was only fighting
      against belief. But, hat in hand, he followed to the Communion rail, and
      there the vicar laid the open book before him. Oh, Philip, shall I ever
      forget it? How it all comes back&mdash;the little dim church, the smell of
      damp and of velvet under the holland covers of the pulpit, and the empty
      place echoing. And grandfather fixed his glasses and leaned over the
      register, but he could see nothing&mdash;only blurr, blurr, blurr.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'<i>You</i> look at it, child,' he said, over his shoulder. But I daren't
      face it; so he rubbed his glasses and leaned over the book again. Oh dear!
      he was like one who looks down the list of the slain for the name he prays
      he may not find. But the name was there, too surely: 'Thomas Wilson
      Christian... to Mona Crellin... signed Wm. Crellin and something
      Kissack.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip's breath came hot and fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little vicar was swinging his cane to and fro on the other side of
      the rail and smiling, and grandfather raised his eyes to him and said, 'Do
      you know what you've done, sir? You've robbed me of my first-born son and
      ruined him.' 'Nonsense, sir,' said the vicar. 'Your son was of age, and
      his wife had the sanction of her father. Was I to go round by Ballawhaine
      for permission to do my duty as a clergyman?' 'Duty!' cried grandfather.
      'When a young man marries, he marries for heaven or for hell. Your duty as
      a clergyman!' he cried, till his voice rang in the roof. 'If a son of
      yours had his hand at his throat, would you call it my duty as Deemster to
      hand him a knife.' 'Silence, sir,' said the vicar. Remember where you
      stand, or, Deemster though you are, you shall repent it.' 'Arrest me for
      brawling, will you?' cried grandfather, and he snatched the cane out of
      the vicar's hand and struck him across the breast. 'Arrest me now,' he
      said, and then tottered and stumbled out of the church by my arm and the
      doors of the empty pews.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip went to bed that night with burning brow and throbbing throat. He
      had made a startling discovery. He was standing where his father had stood
      before him; he was doing what his father had done; he was in danger of his
      father's fate! Where was his head that he had never thought of this
      before?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hard&mdash;it was terrible. Now that he was free to love the girl,
      he realised what it meant to love her. Nevertheless he was young, and he
      rebelled, he fought, he would not deliberate, The girl conquered in his
      heart that night, and he lay down to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      But next morning he told himself, with a shudder, that it was lucky he had
      gone no farther. One step more and all the evil of his father's life might
      have been repeated in his own. There had been nothing said, nothing done.
      He would go to Sulby no more.

    <h2>
      XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      That mood lasted until mid-day, and then a scout of the line of love began
      to creep into his heart in disguise. He reminded himself that he had
      promised to go on Sunday, and that it would be unseemly to break off the
      acquaintance too suddenly, lest the simple folks should think he had borne
      with them throughout four years merely for the sake of Pete. But after
      Sunday he would take a new turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Kate dressed as she had never been before. Instead of the loose
      red bodice and the sun-bonnet, the apron and the kilted petticoat, she
      wore a close-fitting dark green frock with a lace collar. The change was
      simple, but it made all the difference. She was not more beautiful, but
      she was more like a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Sunday evening, and the &ldquo;Fairy&rdquo; was closed. Csesar and Grannie were
      at the preaching-house, Nancy Joe was cooking crowdie for supper, and Kate
      and Philip talked. The girl was quieter than Philip had ever known her&mdash;more
      modest, more apt to blush, and with the old audacity of word and look
      quite gone. They talked of success in life, and she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I should like to fight my way in the world as you are doing! But a
      woman can do nothing to raise herself. Isn't it hard? Whatever the place
      where she was born in, she must remain there all her days. She can see her
      brothers rise, and her friends perhaps, but she must remain below. Isn't
      it a pity? It isn't that she wants to be rich or great. No, not that; only
      she doesn't want to be left behind by the people she likes. She must be,
      though, and just because she's a woman. I'm sure it's so in the Isle of
      Man, anyway. Isn't it cruel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But aren't you forgetting something?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If a woman can't rise of herself because the doors of life are locked to
      her, it is always possible for a man to raise her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one who loves her, you mean, and so lifts her to his own level, and
      takes her up with him as he goes up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate's eyes beamed like sunshine. &ldquo;That is lovely,&rdquo; she said in a low
      voice. &ldquo;Do you know, I never thought of that before! If it were my case, I
      should like that best of all. Side by side with him, and he doing all? Oh,
      that is beautiful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she gazed up with a timid joy at the inventive being who had thought
      of this as at something supernatural.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar and Grannie came back, both in fearful outbursts of Sunday clothes.
      Nevertheless Cæsar's eyes, after the first salutation with Philip, fixed
      themselves on Kate's unfamliar costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such worldly attire!&rdquo; he muttered, following the girl round the kitchen
      and blowing up his black gloves. &ldquo;This caring for the miserable body that
      will one day be lowered into the grave! What does the Book say?&mdash;put
      my tall hat on the clane laff, Nancy. 'Let it not be the outward adorning
      of putting on of apparel, but let it be the hidden man of the heart.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But sakes alive, father,&rdquo; said Grannie, loosening a bonnet like a diver's
      helmet, &ldquo;if it comes to that, what is Jeremiah saying, 'Can a maid forget
      her ornaments?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's like she can if she hasn't any to remember,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;But maybe
      the prophet Jeremiah didn't know the mothers that's in now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chut, man! Girls are like birds, and the breed comes out in the
      feathers,&rdquo; said Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's she getting it then? Not from me at all,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deed, no, man,&rdquo; laughed Grannie, &ldquo;considering the smart she is and the
      rasonable good-looking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hould your tongue, woman; it'll become you better,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip rose to go. &ldquo;You're time enough yet, sir,&rdquo; cried Cæsar. &ldquo;I was for
      telling you of a job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some of the fishermen of Ramsey had been over on Saturday. Their season
      was a failure, and they were loud in their protests against the trawlers
      who were destroying the spawn. Cæsar had suggested a conference at his
      house on the following Saturday of Ramsey men and Peel men, and
      recommended Philip as an advocate to advise with them as to the best means
      to put a stop to the enemies of the herring. Philip promised to be there,
      and then went home to Auntie Nan.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told himself on the way that Kate was completely above her
      surroundings, and capable of becoming as absolute a lady as ever lived on
      the island, without a sign of her origin in look or speech, except perhaps
      the rising inflexion in her voice which made the talk of the true
      Manxwoman the sweetest thing in the world to listen to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Auntie Nan was sitting by the lamp, reading her chapter before going to
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;don't you think the tragedy in the life of father
      was accidental? Due, I mean, to the particular characters of grandfather
      and poor mother? Now, if the one had been less proud, less exclusive, or
      the other more capable of rising with her husband&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tragedy was deeper than that, dear; let me tell you a story,&rdquo; said
      Auntie Nan, laying down her book. &ldquo;Three days after your father left
      Ballawhaine, old Maggie, the housemaid, came to my side at supper and
      whispered that some one was wanting me in the garden. It was Thomas. Oh
      dear! it was terrible to see him there, that ought to have been the heir
      of everything, standing like a stranger in the dark beyond the
      kitchen-door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor father!&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Whist, girl, come out of the light,' he whispered. 'There's a purse with
      twenty pounds odd in my desk upstairs; get it, Nan, here's the key.' I
      knew what he wanted the money for, but I couldn't help it; I got him the
      purse and put ten pounds more of my own in it. 'Must you do it?' I said.
      'I must,' he answered. 'Your father says everybody will despise you for
      this marriage,' I said. 'Better they should than I should despise myself,'
      said he. 'But he calls it moral suicide,' I said. 'That's not so bad as
      moral murder,' he replied. 'He knows the island,' I urged, 'and so do you,
      Tom, and so do I, and nobody can hold up his head in a little place like
      this after a marriage like that.' 'All the worse for the place,' said he,
      'if it stains a man's honour for acting honourably.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father was an upright man,&rdquo; interrupted Philip. &ldquo;There's no question
      about it, my father was a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'She must be a sweet, good girl, and worthy of you, or you wouldn't marry
      her,' said I to father; 'but are you sure that you will be happy and make
      her happy?' We shall have each other, and it is our own affair,' said
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But if there is a difference between you now,' I said, 'will it be less
      when you are the great man we hope to see you some day?' 'A man is not
      always thinking of success,' he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father was a great man already, Auntie,&rdquo; burst out Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was shaken and I was ashamed, but I could not help it, I went on. 'Has
      the marriage gone too far?' I asked. 'It has never been mentioned between
      us,' said he. 'Your father is old, and can't live long,' I pleaded. 'He
      wants me to behave like a scoundrel,' he answered. 'Why that, if the girl
      has no right to you yet?' I said, and he was silent. Then I crept up and
      looked in at the window. 'See,' I whispered, 'he's in the library. We'll
      take him by surprise. Come!' It was not to be. There was a smell of
      tobacco on the air and the thud of a step on the grass. 'Who's that?' I
      said. 'Who should it be,' cried father, 'but the same spy again. I'll
      shake the life out of him yet as a terrier would a rat. No use, girl,' he
      shouted hoarsely, facing towards the darkness, 'they're driving me to
      destruction.' 'Hush!' I said, and covered his mouth with my hands, and his
      breath was hot, like fire. But it was useless. He was married three days
      afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip resolved to see Kate no more. He must go to Sulby on Saturday to
      meet the fishermen, but that would be a business visit; he need not
      prolong it into a friendly one. All the week through he felt as if his
      heart would break; but he resolved to conquer his feelings. He pitied
      himself somewhat, and that helped him to rise above his error.

    <h2>
      XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Saturday night he was early at Sulby. The bat-room was thronged with
      fishermen in guernseys, sea-boots, and sou'-westers. They were all on
      their feet together, twisting about like great congers on the quay,
      drinking a little and smoking a great deal, thumping the table, and all
      talking at once. &ldquo;How've you done, Billy?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Enough to keep away the
      divil and the coroner, and that's about all.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Where's Tom Dug?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Gone
      to Austrilla.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Is Jimmy over to-day?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He's away to
      Cleveland.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Gough, bless me, every Manx boy seems to be going
      foreign.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That's where we'll all be after long and last, if we
      don't stop these southside trawlers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip went in and was received with goodwill and rough courtesy, but no
      man abated a jot of his freedom of action or liberty of speech, and the
      thumping and shouting were as loud as before. &ldquo;Appeal to the
      Receiver-General.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Chut! an ould woman with a face winking at you
      like a roast potato.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Will we go to the Bishop, then?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;A
      whitewashed Methodist with a soul the size of a dried pea.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The
      Governor is the proper person,&rdquo; said Philip above the hubbub, &ldquo;and he is
      to visit Peel Castle next Saturday afternoon about the restorations. Let
      every Manx fisherman who thinks the trawl-boats are enemies of the fish be
      there that day. Then lay your complaint before the man whose duty it is to
      inquire into all such grievances; and if you want a spokesman, I'm ready
      to speak for you.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That's the ticket!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the meeting was at an end; the men went on with stories of the week's
      fishing, stories of smugglers, stories of the Swaddlers (the Wesleyans),
      stories of the totalers (teetotallers), and Philip made for the door. When
      he got there, he began to reflect that, being in the house, he ought to
      leave good-night with Cæsar and Grannie. Hardly decent not to do so. No
      use hurting people's feelings. Might as well be civil. Cost nothing
      anyway. Thus an overpowering compulsion in the disguise of courtesy drew
      him again into Kate's company; but to-morrow he would take a new turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proud to see you, Mr. Philip,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The water's playing in the kettle; make Mr. Philip a cup of tay, Nancy,&rdquo;
       said Grannie. Cæsar was sitting back to the partition, pretending to read
      out of a big Bible on his knees, but listening with both ears and open
      mouth to the profane stories being told in the bar-room. Kate was not in
      the kitchen, but an open book, face downwards, lay on the chair by the
      turf closet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this?&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;A French exercise-book! Whoever can it belong
      to here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, Kirry, of coorse,&rdquo; said Grannie, &ldquo;and sticking that close to it of an
      everin that you haven't a chance to put a word on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vanity, sir, vanity, all vanity,&rdquo; said Cæsar; and again he listened hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip's eyes began to blink. &ldquo;Teaching herself French, is she? Has she
      been doing it long, Grannie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long enough, sir, three years or better, since poor Pete went away maybe;
      and at the books for ever, grammars and tex' books, and I don't know
      what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar, with his ear at the glass, made an impatient gesture for silence,
      but Grannie continued, &ldquo;I don't know what for people should be larning
      themselves foreign languages at all. For my part, there isn't one of them
      bates the Manx itself for plainness. And aren't we reading, when the Lord
      wanted to bring confusion on Noah and his disobedient sons and grandsons
      at going up the Tower of Babel, he made them spake different tongues?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good thing too,&rdquo; snapped Cæsar, &ldquo;if every poor man was bound to carry his
      wife up with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip's eyes were streaming, and, unobserved, he put the lesson-book to
      his lips. He had guessed its secret. The girl was making herself worthy of
      him. God bless, her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate came downstairs in the dark dress and white collar of Sunday night.
      She saw Philip putting down the book, lowered her head and blushed, took
      up the volume, and smuggled it out of sight. Then Cæsar's curiosity
      conquered his propriety and he ventured into the bar-room, Grannie came
      and went between the counter and the fishermen, Nancy clicked about from
      dairy to door, and Kate and Philip were left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were wrong the other night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have been thinking it over,
      and you were quite, quite wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If a man marries a woman beneath him, he stoops to her, and to stoop to
      her is to pity her, and to pity her is to be ashamed of her, and to be
      ashamed of her would kill her. So you are wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;but do you know what it ought to be? The <i>woman</i>
      ought to marry beneath herself, and the man <i>above</i> himself; then as
      much as the woman descends, the man rises, and so&mdash;&mdash;-don't you
      see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She faltered and stopped, and Philip said, &ldquo;Aren't you talking nonsense,'
      Kate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate pretended to be angry at the rebuff, and pouted her lips, but her
      eyes were beaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is neither above nor below where there is real liking,&rdquo; said
      Philip. &ldquo;If you like any one, and she is necessary to your life, that is
      the sign of your natural equality. It is God's sign, and all the rest is
      only man's book-keeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; said Kate, trying to keep a grave mouth, &ldquo;you mean that if a
      woman belongs to some one she can like, and some one belongs to her, that
      is being equal, and everything else is nothing? Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was music to her, but she wagged her head solemnly and said, &ldquo;I'm sure
      you're wrong, Philip. I am, though. Yes, indeed I am. But it's no use
      arguing. Not against you. Only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The glorious choir of love-birds in her bosom were singing so loud that
      she could say no more, and the irresistible one had his way. After a
      while, she stuffed something into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; she answered brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the French exercise-book.

      Philip went home rebelling against his father's fate. It was accidental;
      it was inevitable only in the Isle of Man. But perdition to the place
      where a man could not marry the woman he loved if she chanced to be born
      in the manger instead of the stable loft. Perdition to the land where a
      man could not live unless he was a skunk or a cur. Thank God the world was
      wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night he said to Auntie Nan, &ldquo;Auntie, why didn't father go away when
      he found the tide setting so strongly against him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He always meant to, but he never could,&rdquo; said Auntie Nan. &ldquo;A woman isn't
      like a man, ready to pitch her tent here to-day and there to-morrow. We're
      more like cats, dear, and cling to the places we're used to, if they're
      only ruins of tumbling stones. Your mother wasn't happy in the Isle of
      Man, but she wouldn't leave it. Your father wouldn't go without her, and
      then there was the child. He was here for weal or woe, for life or death.
      When he married his wife he made the chain that bound him to the island as
      to a rock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn't be like that with Kate,&rdquo; thought Philip. But did Auntie know
      anything? Had somebody told her? Was she warning him? On Sunday night, on
      the way home from church, she talked of his father again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came to see at last that it wasn't altogether his own affair either,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;It was the night he died. Your mother had been unwell and
      father had sent for me. It was a dark night, and late, very late, and they
      brought me down the hill from Lewaige Cottage with a lantern. Father was
      sinking, but he <i>would</i> get out of bed. We were alone together then,
      he and I, except for you, and you were asleep in your cot by the window.
      He made straight for it, and struggled down on his knees at its side by
      help of the curtains. 'Listen,' he said, trying to whisper, though he
      could not, for his poor throat was making noises. You were catching your
      breath, as if sobbing in your sleep. 'Poor little boy, he's dreaming,'
      said I; 'let me turn him on his side.' 'It's not that,' said father; 'he
      went to sleep in trouble.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember it, Auntie,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;Perhaps he had been trying to tell
      me something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'My boy, my son, forgive me, I have sinned against you,' he said, and he
      tried to reach over the cot rail and put his lips to your forehead, but
      his poor head shook like palsy and bobbed down into your little face. I
      remember you rubbed your nose with your little fist, but you did not
      waken. Then I helped him back to bed, and the table with the medicine
      glasses jingled by the trembling of his other hand. 'It's dark, all, all
      dark, Nannie,' he said, 'sure some angel will bring me light,' and I was
      so simple I thought he meant the lamp, for it was dying down, and I lit a
      candle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip went about his work that week as if the spirit of his father were
      hovering over him, warning him when awake in words of love and pleading,
      crying to him in his sleep in tones of anger and command, &ldquo;Stand back; you
      are at the edge of the precipice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless his soul rose in rebellion against this league as of the past
      and the dead. It was founded in vanity, in the desire for glory and
      success. Only let a man renounce the world and all that the world can
      give, and he can be true to himself, to his heart's impulse, to his
      honour, and to his love. He would deliberate no longer. He despised
      himself for deliberating. If was the world against Kate, let the world go
      to perdition.

    <h2>
      XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Saturday afternoon he was at Peel. It was a beautiful day; the sun was
      shining, and the bay was blue and flat and quiet. The tide was down, the
      harbour was empty of water, but full of smacks with hanging sails and
      hammocks of nets and lines of mollags (bladders) up to the mast heads. A
      flight of seagulls were fishing in the mud, and swirling through the brown
      wings of the boats and crying. A flag floated over the ruins of the
      castle, the church-bells were ringing, and the harbour-masters were abroad
      in best blue and gold buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the tilting-ground of the castle the fishermen had gathered, sixteen
      hundred strong. There were trawlers among them, Manx, Irish, and English,
      prowling through the crowd, and scooping up the odds and ends of gossip as
      their boats on the bottom scraped up the little fish. Occasionally they
      were observed by the herring-fishers, and then there were high words and
      free fights. &ldquo;Taking a creep round from Port le Murrey are you, Dan?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Thought
      I'd put a sight on Peel to-day.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Bad for your complexion, though;
      might turn it red, I'm thinking.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Strek me with blood will you? I'd
      just like you to strek me, begough. I'd put a Union Jack on your face as
      big as a griddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor came, an elderly man, with a formidable air, an aquiline
      nose, and cheeks pitted with small-pox. Philip introduced the fishermen
      and told their grievance. Trawling destroyed immature fish, and so
      contributed to the failure of the fisheries. They asked for power to stop
      it in the bays of the island, and within three miles of the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then draft me a bill with that object, Mr. Christian,&rdquo; said the Governor,
      and the meeting ended with cheers for His Excellency, shouts for Philip,
      and mutterings of contempt from the trawlers. &ldquo;Didn't think there was a
      man on the island could spake like it.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;But hasn't your fancy-man
      been rubbing his back agen the college?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I'd take lil tacks home if
      I was yourself, Dan.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Drink much more and it'll be two feet deep
      inside of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was hurrying away under the crumbling portcullis, when a deputation
      of the fishermen approached him. &ldquo;What are we owing you, Mr. Christian?&rdquo;
       asked their spokesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We thank you, sir, and you'll be hearing from us again. Meanwhile, a word
      if you plaze, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, men?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a young man can spake like yonder, it's a gift, sir, and he's
      houlding it in trust for something. The ould island's wanting a big man
      ter'ble bad, and it hasn't seen the like since the days of your own
      grandfather. Good everin, and thank you&mdash;good everin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that the rough fellows dismissed him at the ferry steps, and he
      hastened to the market-place, where he had left his horse. On putting up,
      he had seen Cæsar's gig tipped up in the stable-yard. It was now gone,
      and, without asking questions, he mounted and made towards Ramsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the old road by the cliffs, and as he cantered and galloped, he
      hummed, and whistled, and sang, and slashed the trees to keep himself from
      thinking. At the crest of the hill he sighted the gig in front, and at
      Port Lady he came up with it. Kate was driving and Cæsar was nodding and
      dozing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been having a great day, Mr. Christian,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;Wish I could
      say the same for myself; but the heart of man is decaitful, sir, and
      desperately wicked. I'm not one to clap people in the castle and keep them
      from sea for debts of drink, and they're taking a mane advantage. Not a
      penny did I get to-day, sir, and many a yellow sovereign owing to me. If I
      was like some&mdash;now there's that Tom Raby, Glen Meay. He saw Dan the
      Spy coming from the total meeting last night. 'Taken the pledge, Dan?'
      says he. 'Yes, I have,' says Dan. 'I'm plazed to hear it,' says he; 'come
      in and I'll give you a good glass of rum for it.' And Dan took the rum for
      taking the pledge, and there he was as drunk as Mackilley in the castle
      this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip listened as he rode, and a half-melancholy, half-mocking expression
      played on his face. He was thinking of his grandfather, old Iron
      Christian, brought into relation with his mother's father, Capt. Billy
      Ballure, of the dainty gentility of Auntie Nan and the unctuous vulgarity
      of the father of Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar grumbled himself to sleep at last, and then Philip was alone with
      the girl, and riding on her side of the gig. She was quiet at first, but a
      joyous smile lit up her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in the castle, too,&rdquo; she said, with a look of pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun went down over the waters behind them, and cast their brown
      shadows on the road in front; the twilight deepened, the night came down,
      the moon rose in their faces, and the stars appeared. They could hear the
      tramp of the horses' hoofs, the roll of the gig wheels, the wash and boom
      of the sea on their left, and the cry Of the sea-fowl somewhere beneath.
      The lovelinese and warmth of the autumn night stole over Kate, and she
      began to keep up a flow of merry chatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell all the sounds of the fields in the darkness. By the
      moonlight? No; but with my eyes shut, if you like. Now try me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She closed her eyes and went on: &ldquo;Do you hear that&mdash;that patter like
      soft rain? That's oats nearly ripe for harvest. Do you hear that, then&mdash;that
      pit-a-pat, like sheep going by on the street? That's wheat, just ready.
      And there&mdash;that whiss, whiss, whiss? That's barley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened her eyes: &ldquo;Don't you think I'm very clever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip felt an impulse to lean over the wheel and put his arms about the
      girl's neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; she cried merrily; &ldquo;your horse is shying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at her face, lit up in the white moonlight. &ldquo;How bright and happy
      you seem, Kate!&rdquo; he said with a shiver; and then he laid one hand on the
      gig rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyelids quivered, her mouth twitched, and she answered gaily, &ldquo;Why
      not? Aren't you? You ought to be, you know. How glorious to succeed? It
      means so much&mdash;new things to see, new houses to visit, new pleasures,
      new friends&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her joyous tones broke down in a nervous laugh at that last word, and he
      replied, in a faltering voice, &ldquo;That may be true of the big world over
      yonder, Kate, but it isn't so in a little island like ours. To succeed
      here is like going up the tower of Castle Rushen with some one locking the
      doors on the stone steps behind you. At every storey the room becomes
      less, until at the top you have only space to stand alone. Then, if you
      should ever come down again, there's but one way for you&mdash;over the
      battlements with a crash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him with startled eyes, and his own were large and full
      of trouble. They were going through Kirk Michael by the house of the
      Deemster, who was ill, and both drew rein and went slowly. Some acacias in
      the garden slashed their broadswords in the night air, and a windmill
      behind stood out against the moon like a gigantic bat. The black shadow of
      the horses stepped beside them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you feeling lonely to-night, Philip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm feeling&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm feeling as if the dead and the living, the living and the dead&mdash;oh,
      Kate, Kate, I don't know what I'm feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her hand caressingly on the top of his hand. &ldquo;Never mind, dear,&rdquo;
       she said softly; &ldquo;I'll stand by you. You shan't be <i>alone</i>.&rdquo;

      XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was midday, then, on the tropic seas, and the horizon was closing in
      with clouds as of blood and vapours of stifling heat. A steamship was
      rolling in a heavy swell, under winds that were as hot as gusts from an
      open furnace. Under its decks a man lay in an atmosphere of fever and the
      sickening odour of bandages and stale air. Above the throb of the engines
      and the rattle of the rudder chain he heard a step going by his open door,
      and he called in a feeble voice that was cheerful and almost merry, but
      yet the voice of a homesick boy&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many days from home, engineer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more than twenty now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put on steam, mate; put it on. Wish I could be skipping below and stoking
      up for you like mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the ship rolled, the green reflection of the water and the red light of
      the sky shot alternately through the porthole and lit up the berth like
      firelight flashing in a dead house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask the boys if they'll carry me on deck, sir&mdash;just for a breath of
      fresh air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailors came and carried him. &ldquo;You can do anything for a chap like
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The big sun was straight overhead, weighing down on their shoulders, and
      there was no shelter anywhere, for the shadows were under foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slip out the sails, lads, and let's fly along. Wish I could tumble up the
      rigging myself and look out from the yards same as a gull, but I'm only an
      ould parrot chained down to my stick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They left him, and he gazed out on the circle of water and the vapour
      shaking over it like a veil. The palpitating air was making the circle
      smaller every minute, but the world seem cruelly large for all that. He
      was looking beyond the visible things; he was listening deeper than the
      wash of the waves; he was dreaming, dreaming. Apparitions were floating in
      the heat-clouds over him. Home! Its voices whispered at his ear, its face
      peered into his eyes. But the hot winds came up and danced round him; the
      air, the sea, the sky, the whole world, the utter universe seemed afire;
      his eyes rolled upwards to his brow; he almost choked and fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carry him below, poor fellow! He's got a good heart to think he'll ever
      see home again. He'll never see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half-way down the companion-ladder he opened his eyes with a look of
      despair. Would God let him die after all?

    <h2>
      XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kate began to feel that Philip was slipping away from her. He loved her,
      she was sure of that, but something was dragging them apart Her great
      enemy was Philip's success. This was rapid and constant. She wanted to
      rejoice in it; she struggled to feel glad and happy, and even proud. But
      that was impossible. It was ungenerous, it was mean, but she could not
      help it&mdash;she resented every fresh mark of Philip's advancement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world that was carrying Philip up was carrying him away. She would be
      left far below. It would be presumptuous to lift her eyes to him. Visions
      came to her of Philip in other scenes than her scenes, among ladies in
      drawing-rooms, beautiful, educated, clever, able to talk of many things
      beyond her knowledge. Then she looked at herself, and felt vexed with her
      hands, made coarse by the work of the farm; at her father, and felt
      ashamed of the moleskin clothes he wore in the mill; at her home, and
      flushed deep at the thought of the bar-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was small and pitiful, she knew that, and she shuddered under the sense
      of being a meaner-hearted girl than she had ever thought. If she could do
      something of herself to counteract the difference made by Philip's
      success, if she could raise herself a little, she would be content to keep
      behind, to let him go first, to see him forge ahead of her, and of
      everybody, being only in sight and within reach. But she could do nothing
      except writhe and rebel against the network of female custom, or tear
      herself in the thorny thicket of female morals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harvest had begun; half the crop of Glenmooar had been saved, a third was
      in stook, and then a wet day had come and stopped all work in the fields.
      On this wet day, in the preaching-room of the mill, amid forms and desks,
      with the cranch of the stones from below, the wash of the wheel from
      outside, and the rush of the uncrushed corn from above, Cæsar sat rolling
      sugganes for the stackyard, with Kate working the twister, and going
      backward before him, and half his neighbours sheltering from the rain and
      looking on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought I'd have a sight up and tell you,&rdquo; said Kelly, the postman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the news, Mr. Kelly?&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ould Dempster's dying,&rdquo; said Kelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say?&rdquo; said everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as good as dying at ten minutes wanting eight o'clock this
      morning,&rdquo; said the postman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The drink's been too heavy for the man,&rdquo; said John, the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wine is a serpent, and strong drink a mocker,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who'll be the new Dempster, Mr. Niplightly,&rdquo; said Jonaique.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; snuffled the constable, easing his helmet, &ldquo;dat's a serious matter,
      Mr. Jelly. We'll dake our time&mdash;well dake our time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chut! There's only one man for it,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps yes, perhaps no,&rdquo; said the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mane the young Ballawhaine, Mr. Cregeen?&rdquo; said the postman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I mane fiddlesticks!&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the man's father is at the Govenar reg'lar, they're telling me,&rdquo;
       said Kelly, &ldquo;and Ross is this, and Ross is that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every dog praises his own tail,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not denying it, the man isn't fit&mdash;he has sold himself to the
      devil, that's a fact&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he hasn't,&rdquo; said Cæsar, &ldquo;the devil gets the like for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he's a Christian for all, and the Christians have been Dempsters time
      out of time&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he the only Christian that's in, then, eh?&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;Go on, Kate;
      twist away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it Mr. Philip? Aw, I'm saying nothing against Mr. Philip,&rdquo; said the
      postman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't get lave in this house, anyway,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, a right gentleman and no pride at all,&rdquo; said the postman. &ldquo;As free
      and free with a poor man, and no making aisy either. I've nothing agen him
      myself. No, but a bit young for a Dempster, isn't he? Just a taste young,
      as the man said, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Older than the young Ballawhaine, anyway,&rdquo; said John, the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, make him Dempster, then. I'm raising no objection,&rdquo; said Mr. Kelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, girl. Does that twister want oiling? Feed it, woman, feed it,&rdquo;
       said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father should have been Dempster before him,&rdquo; said John, the clerk.
      &ldquo;Would have been too, only he went crooked when he married on yonder
      woman. She's through though, and what more natural&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rope stopped again, and Kate's voice, hard and thick, came from the
      farther end of it. &ldquo;His mother being dead, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the mother that done for the father, anyway,&rdquo; said the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consequently,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;he is to praise God that his mother is gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That girl wants a doctor,&rdquo; muttered Jonaique.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man couldn't drag the woman up after him,&rdquo; began the clerk. &ldquo;It's
      always the way&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just that,&rdquo; said Kate, with bitter irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of coorse, I'm not for saying it was the woman's fault entirely&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't apologise for her,&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;She's gone and forgotten, and that
      being so, her son has now a chance of being Deemster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he has,&rdquo; shouted Cæsar, &ldquo;and not second Dempster only, but first
      Dempster itself in time, and go on with the twister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate laughed loudly, and cried, &ldquo;Why don't you keep it up when your hand's
      in? First Deemster Christian, and then Sir Philip Christian, and then Lord
      Christian, and then&mdash;&mdash;But you're talking nonsense, and you're a
      pack of tattlers. There's no thought of making Philip Christian a
      Deemster, and no hope of it and no chance of it, and I trust there never
      will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she flung the twister on the floor and rushed out of the mill,
      sobbing hysterically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Clucas is wonderful for females and young girls,&rdquo; said Jonaique.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's that Ross again,&rdquo; muttered Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he'll have her yet,&rdquo; said Kelly, the postman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd see her dead first,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;It would be the jaws of hell and
      the mouth of Satan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That she who loved Philip to distraction should be the first to abuse and
      defame him was agony near to madness, for Kate knew where she stood. It
      was not merely that Philip's success was separating them, not merely that
      the conventions of life, its usages, its manners, and its customs were
      putting worlds between them. The pathos of the girl's position was no
      accidental thing. It was a deeper, older matter; it was the same to-day as
      it had been yesterday and would be to-morrow; it began in the garden of
      Eden and would go on till the last woman died&mdash;-it was the natural
      inferiority of woman in relation to man.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had the same passions as Philip, and was moved by the same love. But
      she was not free. Philip alone was free. She had to wait on Philip's will,
      on Philip's word. She saw Philip slipping away from her, but she could not
      snatch at him before he was gone; she could not speak first; she could not
      say, &ldquo;I love you; stay with me!&rdquo; She was a woman, only a woman! How
      wretched to be a woman! How cruel!
    </p>
    <p>
      But ah! the dear delicious thought! It came stealing up into her heart
      when the red riot was nearly killing her. What a glorious thing it was to
      be a woman after all! What a powerful thing! What a lovely and beloved
      thing! To rule the king, being the slave, was sweeter than to be the king
      himself. That was woman's place. It was where heaven itself had put her
      from the beginning until now. What weapons had it given her! Beauty!
      Charm! Love! The joy of it! To be the weak and overcome the strong! To be
      nothing in the battle of life, and yet conqueror of all the world!
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate vowed that, come what would, Philip should never leave her.

    <h2>
      XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the day when the last of the harvest is saved in the Isle of Man, the
      farmer gives a supper to his farm-people, and to the neighbours who have
      helped him to cut and house it. This supper, attended by simple and
      beautiful ceremonies, is called the Melliah. The parson may be asked to
      it, and if there is a friend of position and free manners, he also is
      invited. Cæsar's Melliah fell within a week of the rope-making in the
      mill, and partly to punish Kate, partly to honour himself, he asked Philip
      to be present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll come,&rdquo; thought Kate with secret joy, &ldquo;I'm sure he'll come;&rdquo; and in
      this certainty, when the day of Melliah came, she went up to her room to
      dress for it. She was to win Philip that day or lose him for ever. It was
      to be her trial day&mdash;she knew that. She was to fight as for her life,
      and gain or lose everything. It was to be a battle royal between all the
      conventions of life, all the network of female custom, all the inferiority
      of a woman's position as God himself had suffered it to be, and one poor
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to cry, but struggling with her sadness, she dashed the tears
      from her glistening eyes. What was there to cry about? Philip <i>wanted</i>
      to love her, and he should, he must.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a glorious day, and not yet more than two o'clock. Nancy had washed
      up the dinner things, the fire-irons were polished, the boots and spare
      whips were put up on, the lath, the old hats like lines of heads on a city
      gate were hung round the kitchen walls, the hearthrug was down, the turf
      was piled up on the fire, the kettle was singing from the slowrie, and the
      whole house was taking its afternoon nap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate's bedroom looked over the orchard and across the stackyard up the
      glen. She could see the barley stack growing in the haggard; the laden
      cart coming down the glen road with the driver three decks up over the
      mare, now half smothered and looking suddenly little, like a snail under
      the gigantic load; and beyond the long meadow and the Bishop's bridge, the
      busy fields dotted with the yellow stooks and their black shadows like a
      castle's studded doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had thrown off her blue-black dress to wash her arms and
      shoulders and neck were bare. She caught sight of herself in the glass,
      and laughed with delight. The years had brought her a fuller flow of life.
      She was beautiful, and she knew it. And Philip knew it too, but he should
      know it to day as he had never known it before. She folded her arms in
      their roundness over her bosom in its fulness and walked up and down the
      little room over the sheep-skin rugs, under the turfy scraas, glowing in
      the joy of blooming health and conscious loveliness. Then she began to
      dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took from a drawer two pairs of stockings, one black and the other
      red, and weighed their merits with moral gravity&mdash;which? The red had
      it, and then came the turn of the boots. There was a grand new pair, with
      countless buttons, two toecaps like two flowers, and an upward curve like
      the arm of a glove. She tried them on, bent back and forward, but
      relinquished them with a sigh in favour of plain shoes cut under the
      ankles and tied with tape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hair was a graver matter. Its tangled curls had never satisfied her.
      She tried all means to bring them into subjection; but the roll on top was
      ridiculous, and the roll behind was formal. She attempted long waves over
      the temples. It was impossible. With a lash-comb she dragged her hair back
      to its natural lawlessness, and when it fell on her forehead and over her
      ears and around her white neck in little knowing rings that came and went,
      and peeped out and slid back, like kittens at hide-and-seek, she laughed
      and was content.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a recess covered by a shawl running on a string she took down her
      bodice. It was a pink blouse, loose over the breast, like hills of red
      sand on the shore, and loose, too, over the arms, but tight at the wrist.
      When she put it on it lit up her head like a gleam from the sunset, and
      her eyes danced with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The skirt was a print, with a faint pink flower, the sash was a band of
      cotton of the colour of the bodice, and then came the solemn problems of
      the throat. It was round, and full, and soft, and like a tower. She would
      have loved to leave it bare, but dared not. Out of a drawer under the
      looking-glass she took a string of pearls. They were a present from
      Kimberley, and they hung over her fingers a moment and then slipped back.
      A white silk handkerchief, with a watermark, was chosen instead. She tied
      it in a sailor's knot, with the ends flying loose, and the triangular
      corner lying down her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last of all, she took out of a box a broad white straw hat, like an oyster
      shell, with a silver-grey ribbon, and a sweeping ostrich feather.. She
      looked at it a moment, blew on it, plucked at its ribbon, lifted it over
      her head, held it at poise there, dropped it gently on to her hair, stood
      back from the glass to see it, and finally tore it off and sent it
      skimming on to the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The substitute was her everyday sun-bonnet, which had been lying on the
      floor by the press. It was also of pale pink, with spots on its print like
      little shells on a big scallop. When she had tossed it over her black
      curls, leaving the strings to fall on her bosom, she could not help but
      laugh aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, she was dressed exactly the same as on other days of life,
      except Sunday, only smarter, perhaps, and fresher maybe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun-bonnet was right though, and she began to play with it. It was so
      full of play; it lent itself to so many moods. It could speak; it could
      say anything. She poked it to a point, as girls do when the sun is hot, by
      closing its mouth over the tip of her nose, leaving only a slumberous dark
      cave visible, through which her black eyes gleamed and her eyelashes
      shone. She tied the strings under her chin, and tipped the bonnet back on
      to her neck, as girls will when the breeze is cool, leaving her hair
      uncovered, her mouth twitching merrily, and her head like a nymph-head in
      an aureole. She took it off and tossed it on her arm, the strings still
      knotted, swinging it like a basket, then wafting it like a fan, and
      walking as she did so to and fro in the room, the floor creaking, her
      print frock crinkling, and she herself laughing with the thrill of passion
      vibrating and of imagined things to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she went downstairs with a firm and buoyant step, her fresh lithe
      figure aglow with young blood and bounding health.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the gate of the &ldquo;haggard&rdquo; she met Nancy Joe coming out of the
      washhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord save us alive!&rdquo; exclaimed Nancy. &ldquo;If I ever wanted to be a man until
      this day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate kissed and hugged her, then fled away to the Melliah field.

    <h2>
      XXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Philip, in Douglas, had received the following communication from
      Government House:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Excellency will be obliged to Mr. Philip Christian if he will not
      leave the island for the present without acquainting him of his
      destination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The message was a simple one: it said little, and involved and
      foreshadowed nothing, but it threw Philip into a condition of great
      excitement. To relieve his restlessness by giving way to it, he went out
      to walk. It was the end of the tourist season, and the <i>Ben-my-Chree</i>
      was leaving the harbour. Newsboys, burrowing among the crowds on the pier
      to sell a Manx evening paper, were crying, &ldquo;Illness of the Deemster&mdash;serious
      reports.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip's hair seemed to rise from his head. The two things came together
      in his mind. With an effort to smudge out the connection he turned back to
      his lodgings, looking at everything that his eyes fell on in the rattling
      streets, speaking to everybody he knew, but seeing nothing and hearing
      nobody. The beast of life had laid its claws on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in his rooms, he took out of his pocket a packet which Auntie Nan had
      put in his hand when he was leaving Ramsey. It was a bundle of his
      father's old letters to his sister cousin, written from London in the days
      when he was studying law and life was like the opening dawn. &ldquo;The ink is
      yellow now,&rdquo; said Auntie Nan; &ldquo;it was black then, and the hand that wrote
      them is cold. But the blood runs red in them yet. Read them, Philip,&rdquo; she
      said with a meaning look, and then he was sure she knew of Sulby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip read his father's letters until it was far into the night, and he
      had gone through every line of them. They were as bright as sunshine, as
      free as air, easy, playful, forcible, full of picture, but, above all,
      egotistical, proud with the pride of intellectuality, and vain with the
      certainty of success. It was this egotism that fascinated Philip. He
      sniffed it up as a colt sniffs the sharp wind. There was no need to make
      allowances for it. The castles which his father had been building in the
      air were only as hovels to the golden palaces which his son's eager spirit
      was that night picturing. Philip devoured the letters. It was almost as if
      he had written them himself in some other state of being. The message from
      Government House lay on a table at his right, and sometimes he put his
      open hand over it as he sat close under the lamp on a table at his left
      and read on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ... &ldquo;Heard old Broom in the House last night, and today I lunched with him
      at Tabley's. They call him an orator and the king of conversationalists.
      He speaks like a pump, and talks like a bottle running water. No
      conviction, no sincerity, no appeal. Civil enough to me though, and when
      he heard that father was a Deemster, he told me the title meant Doomster,
      and then asked me if I knew the meaning of 'House of Keys,' and said it
      had its origin in the ancient Irish custom of locking the muniment chests
      with twenty-four keys, whereof each counsellor kept one. When he had left
      us Tabley asked if he wasn't a wonderful man, and if he didn't know
      something of everything, and I said, 'Yes, except the things of which I
      knew a little, and of them he knew nothing.'... My pen runs, runs. But,
      Nannie, my little Nannie, if this is what London calls a great man, I'll
      kick the ball like a toy before me yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      ... &ldquo;So you are wondering where I am living&mdash;in man-sion or attic!
      Behold me then in Brick Court, Temple, second floor. Goldsmith wrote the
      'Vicar' on the third, but I've not got up to that yet. His rooms were
      those immediately above me. I seem to see him coming down past my door in
      that wonderful plum-coloured coat. And sitting here at night I think of
      him&mdash;the sudden fear, the solitary death, then these stairs thronged
      with his pensioners, the mighty Burke pushing through, Reynolds with his
      ear-trumpet, and big 'blinking Sam,' and last of all the unknown grave,
      God knows where, by the chapel wall. Poor little Oliver! They say it was a
      women that was 'in' at the end. No more of the like now, no more debts, no
      more vain 'talk like poor Poll:' the light's out&mdash;all still and
      dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      ... &ldquo;How's my little Nannie? Does she still keep a menagerie for sick dogs
      and lost cats? And how's the parson-gull with the broken wing, and does he
      still strut like Parson Kis-sack in his surplice? I was at Westminster
      Hall yesterday. It was the great trial of Mitchell, M. P., who forged his
      father's will. Stevens defended&mdash;bad, bad, bad, smirking all the
      while with small facetiæ. But Denman's summing up&mdash;oh! oh! such
      insight, such acuteness! It was wonderful. I had a seat in the gallery.
      The grand old hall was a thrilling scene&mdash;the dense throng, the
      upturned faces, the counsel, the judges, the officers of court, and then
      the windows, the statues, the echo of history that made every stone and
      rafter live&mdash;Oh, Nan, Nan, listen to me! If I live I'll sit on the
      bench there some day&mdash;I will, so help me God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Philip had finished his father's letters, he was on the heights, and
      poor Kate was left far below, out of reach and out of sight. Hitherto his
      ambitions had been little more than the pale shadow of his father's hopes,
      but now they were his own realities.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next morning the letter came from Cæsar inviting him to the Melliah, and
      then he thought of Kate more tenderly. She would suffer, she would cry&mdash;it
      would make his heart bleed to see her; but must he for a few tears put by
      the aims of a lifetime? If only Pete had been alive! If only Pete were yet
      to come home! He grew hot and ashamed when he remembered the time, so
      lately past, when the prayer of his secret heart would have been
      different. It was so easy now to hate himself for such evil impulses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip decided to go to the Melliah. It would give him the chance he
      wanted of breaking off the friendship finally. More than friendship there
      had never been, except secretly, and that could not count. He knew he was
      deceiving himself; he felt an uneasy sense of loss of honour and a sharp
      pang of tender love as often as Kate's face rose up before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day of the Melliah he set off early, riding by way of St. John's
      that he might inquire at Kirk Michael about the Deemster.. He found the
      great man's house a desolate place. The gate was padlocked, and he had to
      clamber over it; the acacias slashed above him going down the path, and
      the fallen leaves encumbered his feet At the door, which was shut, he
      rang, and before it was opened to him an old woman put her untidy head out
      of a little window at the side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's scandalous the doings that's here, sir,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;The
      Dempster's gone into 'sterics with the drink, and the lil farmer fellow,
      Billiam Cowley, is over and giving him as much as he wants, and driving
      everybody away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I speak to him?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billiam? It isn't fit. He'll blackguard you mortal, and the Dempster
      himself is past it. Just sitting with the brandy and drinking and
      drinking, and ateing nothing; but that dirt brought up on the Curragh
      shouting for beefstakes morning and night, and having his dinner laid on a
      beautiful new white sheet as clane as a bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the ambush of a screen before an open door, Philip looked into the
      room where the Deemster was killing himself. The window shutters were up
      to keep out the daylight; candles were burning in the necks of bottles on
      the mantelpiece; a fire smouldered in a grate littered with paper and
      ashes; a coarse-featured man was eating ravenously at the table, a
      chop-bone in his fingers, and veins like cords moving on his low forehead&mdash;and
      the Deemster himself, judge of his island since the death of Iron
      Christian, was propped up in a chair, with a smoking glass on a stool
      beside him, and a monkey perched on his shoulder. &ldquo;Turn them out, neck and
      crop, Dempster; the women are all for robbing a man,&rdquo; said the fellow; and
      a husky, eaten-out voice replied to him with a grunt and a laugh, &ldquo;H'm!
      That's only what you're doing yourself, then, you rascal, and if I'd let
      the right one in long ago you wouldn't be here now&mdash;nor I neither,
      would I, Jacko?&rdquo; The tail of the monkey flapped on the Deemster's breast,
      and Philip crept away with a shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was shining brightly outside the house, and the air was fresh and
      sweet. Remounting his horse, which was neighing and stamping at the gate,
      Philip rode hard to bring back a sense of warmth. At the &ldquo;Fairy&rdquo; he
      alighted and put up, and saw Grannie, who was laying tables in the mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm busy as Trap's wife,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and if you were the Govenar itself
      you wouldn't get lave to spake to me now. Put a sight on himself on the
      field yonder, the second meadow past the Bishop's bridge, and come back
      with the boys to supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip found the Melliah field. Two-score workers, men, women, and
      children, a cart and a pair of horses were scattered over it. Where the
      corn had been cut the day before the stubble had been woven overnight into
      a white carpet of cobwebs, which neither sun nor step of man had yet
      dispelled. There were the smell of the straw, the cawing of the rooks in
      the glen, the hissing to the breeze of the barley still standing, the
      swish of the scythe and the gling of the sickle, the bending and rising of
      the shearers, the swaying of the binders dragging the sheaves, the gluck
      of the wheels of the cart, the merry head of a child peeping out of a
      stook like a young bird out of the broken egg, and a girl in scarlet, whom
      Philip recognised, standing at the farthest hedge, and waving the corn
      band with which she was tieing to some one below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip vaulted into the field, and was instantly seized by every woman
      working in it, except Kate, tied up with the straw ropes, and only
      liberated on paying the toll of an intruder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I've come to work,&rdquo; he protested, and Cæsar who, was plotting the
      last rigs of the harvest, paired him with Kate and gave him a sickle.
      &ldquo;He's a David, he'll smite down his thousands/,&rdquo; said Cæsar. Then cocking
      his eye up the field, &ldquo;the Ballabeg for leader,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;he's a
      plate-ribbed man. And let ould Maggie take the butt along with him. Jemmy
      the Red for the after-rig, and Robbie to follow Mollie with the cart Now
      ding-dong, boys, bend your backs and down with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate had not looked up when Philip came into the field, but she had seen
      him come, and she gave a little start when he took his place in his
      shirt-sleeves beside her. He used some conventional phrases which she
      scarcely answered, and then nothing was heard but the sounds of the sickle
      and the corn. She worked steadily for some time, and he looked up at her
      at intervals with her round bare arms and supple waist and firm-set foot
      and tight red stocking. Two butterflies tumbling in the air played around
      her sun bonnet and a lady-clock settled on her wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time was called for rest as Nancy Joe came through the gate bringing a
      basket with bottles and a can.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The belly's a malefactor that forgets former kindness,&rdquo; said Cæsar; &ldquo;ate
      and drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the men formed a group about the ale, the older women drank tea, the
      children making bands were given butter-milk, and the younger women with
      babes went cooing and clucking to the hedge where the little ones lay
      nuzzled up and unattended, some asleep in shawls, some awake on their
      backs and grabbing at the wondrous forests of marguerites towering up
      beside them, and all crying with one voice at sight of the breast, which
      the mothers were as glad to give as they to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rooks cawed in the glen, there was a hot hum of bees, and a company of
      starlings passed overhead, glittering in the sunlight like the scales of a
      herring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're taiching us a lesson,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;They're going together over
      the sea; but there's someones on earth would sooner go to heaven itself
      solitary, and take joy if they found themselves all alone and the cock of
      the walk there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate and Philip stood and talked where they had been shearing quietly,
      simply, without apparent interest, and meanwhile the workers discussed
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      First the men: &ldquo;He works his siggle like a man though.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;A stout boy
      anyway; give him practice and he'd shear many a man in bed.&rdquo; Then the
      women: &ldquo;She's looking as bright as a pewter pot, and she's all so pretty
      as the Govenar's daughter too.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Got a good heart, though. Only last
      week she had word of Pete, and look at the scarlet perricut.&rdquo; Finally both
      men and women: &ldquo;Lave her alone, mother; it's that Ross that's wasting the
      woman.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, if I was a man I'd know my tack.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Wouldn't
      trust. It comes with Cæsar anyway; the Lord prospers him; she'll have her
      pickings. Nothing bates religion in this world. It's like going to the
      shop with an ould Manx shilling&mdash;you get your pen'orth of taffy and
      twelve pence out.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Lend's a hand with the jough then, boy. None
      left? Aw, Cæsar's wonderful religious, but there's never much lavings of
      ale with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar was striding through the stooks past Philip and Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it thrash well, Mr. Cregeen?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight bolls to the acre maybe, but no straw to spake of, sir,&rdquo; said
      Cæsar. &ldquo;Now, boys, let the weft rest on the last end, finish your work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The workers fell to again, and the sickle of the leader sang round his
      head as he hacked and blew and sent off his breath in spits until the
      green grass springing up behind him left only a triangular corner of
      yellow corn. Fore-rig and the after-rig took a tussle together, and
      presently nothing was standing of all the harvest of Glenmooar but one
      small shaft of ears a yard wide or less. Then the leaders stopped, and all
      the shearers of the field came up and cast down their sickles into the
      soil in a close circle, making a sheaf of crescent moons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for the Melliah,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;Who's to be Queen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a cry for Kate, and she sailed forward buoyantly, fresh still,
      warm with her work, and looking like the afterglow from the sunset in the
      lengthening shadows from the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike them from their legs, Kirry,&rdquo; cried Nancy Joe, and Kate drew up
      one of the sickles, swept her left arm over the standing corn, and at a
      single stroke of her right brought the last ears to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a great shout. &ldquo;Hurrah for the Mel-liah!&rdquo; It rang through
      the glen and echoed in the mountains. Grannie heard it in the valley, and
      said to herself, &ldquo;Cæsar's Melliah's took.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we've gathered the ripe corn, praise His name,&rdquo; said Cæsar, &ldquo;but
      what shall be done at the great gathering for unripe Christians?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate lifted her last sheaf and tied it about with a piece of blue ribbon,
      and Philip plucked the cushag (the ragwort) from the hedge, and gave it
      her to put in the band.
    </p>
    <p>
      This being done; the Queen of the Melliah stepped back, feeling Philip's
      eyes following her, while the oldest woman shearer came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've a crown-piece, here that's being lying in my pocket long enough,
      Joney,&rdquo; said Cæsar with an expansive air, and he gave the woman her
      accustomed dole.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a timid, shrinking creature, having a face walled with wrinkles,
      and wearing a short blue petticoat, showing heavy dull boots like a man's,
      and thick black stockings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the young fellows went racing over the field, vaulting the stooks,
      stretching a straw rope for the girls to jump over, heightening and
      tightening it to trip them up, and slacking and twirling it to make them
      skip. And the girls were falling with a laugh, and leaping up again and
      flying off like the dust, tearing their frocks and dropping their
      sun-bonnets as if the barley grains they had been reaping had got into
      their blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this maddening frolic, while Cæsar and the others were
      kneeling behind the barley stack, Kate snatched Philip's hat from his head
      and shot like a gleam into the depths of the glen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip dragged up his coat by one of its arms and fled after her.

    <h2>
      XXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sulby Glen is winding, soft, rich, sweet, and exquisitely beautiful. A
      thin thread of blue water, laughing, babbling, brawling, whooping,
      leaping, gliding, and stealing down from the mountains; great boulders
      worn smooth and ploughed hollow by the wash of ages; wet moss and lichen
      on the channel walls; deep, cool dubbs; tiny reefs; little cascades of
      boiling foam; lines of trees like sentinels on either side, making the
      light dim through the overshadowing leafage; gaunt trunks torn up by winds
      and thrown across the stream with their heads to the feet of their
      fellows; the golden fuschia here, the green trammon there; now and again a
      poor old tholthan, a roofless house, with grass growing on its kitchen
      floor; and over all the sun peering down with a hundred eyes into the dark
      and slumberous gloom, and the breeze singing somewhere up in the tree-tops
      to the voice of the river below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate had run out on the stem of one of the fallen trees, and there Philip
      found her, over the middle of the stream, laughing, dancing, waving his
      hat in one hand, and making sweeping bows to her reflection in the water
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You terrible girl, you'll fall. Sit down there&mdash;don't
      torment me, sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a curtsey to him she turned her attention to her skirts, wound them
      about her ankles, sat on the trunk, and dangled her shapely feet half an
      inch over the surface of the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Philip had time to observe that the other end of the tree did not
      reach the opposite bank, but dipped short into the water. So he barricaded
      his end by sitting on it, and said triumphantly: &ldquo;My hat, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate looked and gave a little cry of alarm and then a chuckle, and then
      she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought you'd caught me, didn't you? You can't, though,&rdquo; and she
      dropped on to a boulder from which she might have skipped ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't, can't I?&rdquo; said Philip; and he twisted a smaller boulder on his
      side, so that Kate was surrounded by water and cut off from the bank. &ldquo;My
      hat now, madam,&rdquo; he said with majestic despotism. 10
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not deliver it, so he pretended to leave her where she was.
      &ldquo;Good-bye, then; good evening,&rdquo; he cried over the laughter of the stream,
      and turned away a step bareheaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later his confidence was dashed. When he turned his head back
      Kate had whipped off her shoes and stockings, and was ramming the one
      inside the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; cried Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catch this&mdash;and this,&rdquo; she said, flinging the shoes across to him.
      Then clapping his straw hat on the crown of her sun-bonnet, she tucked up
      her skirts with both hands and waded ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a clever boy you are! You thought you'd caught me again, didn't
      you?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've caught your shoes, anyway,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;and until you give me my
      hat I'll stick to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was on the shingle, but in her bare feet, and could not make a step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My shoes, please?&rdquo; she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My hat first,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you must give it me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never! I'll sit here all night first,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm willing,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were sitting thus, the one bare-headed, the other with bare feet, and
      on the same stone, as if seats in the glen were scarce, when there came
      the sound of a hymn from the field they had left, and then it was agreed
      by way of mutual penalty that Kate should put on Philip's hat on condition
      that Philip should be required to put on Kate's shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the next moment Philip, suddenly sobered, was reproaching himself
      fiercely. What was he doing? He had come to tell Kate that he should come
      no more, and this was how he had begun! Yesterday he was in Douglas
      reading his father's letters, and here he was to-day, forgetting himself,
      his aims in life, his duties, his obligations&mdash;everything. &ldquo;Philip,&rdquo;
       he thought, &ldquo;you are as weak as water. Give up your plans; you are not fit
      for them; abandon your hopes&mdash;they are too high for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How solemn we are all at once!&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hymn (a most doleful strain, dragged out to death on every note) was
      still coming from the Melliah field, and she added, slyly, shyly, with a
      mixture of boldness and nervousness, &ldquo;Do you think this world is so very
      bad, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;aw&mdash;no,&rdquo; he faltered, and looking up he met her eye, and
      they both laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all nonsense, isn't it?&rdquo; she said, and they began to walk down the
      glen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where are we going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we'll come out this way just as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The scutch grass, the long rat-tail, and the golden cushag were swishing
      against his riding-breeches and her print dress. &ldquo;I must tell her now,&rdquo; he
      thought. In the narrow places she went first, and he followed with a
      lagging step, trying to begin. &ldquo;Better prepare her,&rdquo; he thought. But he
      could think of no commonplace leading up to what he wished to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, through a tangle of wild fuchsia, there was a smell of burning
      turf in the air and the sound of milking into a pail, and then a voice
      came up surprisingly as from the ground, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aisy on the thatch, Miss Cregeen, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was old Joney, the shearer, milking her goat, and Kate had stepped on
      to the roof of her house without knowing it, for the little place was low
      and opened from the water's edge and leaned against the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip made some conventional inquiries, and she answered that she had
      been thirty years there, and had one son living with her, and he was an
      imbecile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was once a flock at me, and I was as young as you are then, miss,
      and all as happy; but they're laving me one by one, except this one, and
      he isn't wise, poor boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip tried to steel his heart. &ldquo;It is cruel,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;it will hurt
      her; but what must be, must be.&rdquo; She began to sing and went carolling down
      the glen, keeping two paces in front of him. He followed like an assassin
      meditating the moment to strike. &ldquo;He is going to say something,&rdquo; she
      thought, and then she sang louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate,&rdquo; he called huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she only clapped her hands, and cried in a voice of delight, &ldquo;The
      echo! Here's the echo! Let's shout to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her kindling features banished his purpose for the time, and he delivered
      himself to her play. Then she called up the gill, &ldquo;Ec&mdash;ho! Ec&mdash;ho!&rdquo;
       and listened, but there was no response, and she said, &ldquo;It won't answer to
      its own name. What shall I call?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, anything,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phil&mdash;ip! Phil&mdash;ip!&rdquo; she called, and then said pettishly, &ldquo;No,
      Philip won't hear me either.&rdquo; She laughed. &ldquo;He's always so stupid though,
      and perhaps he's asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More this way,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;Try now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip took up the call. &ldquo;Kate!&rdquo; he shouted, and back came the answer, <i>Ate!</i>
      &ldquo;Kate&mdash;y!&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Ate&mdash;y</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! how quick! Katey's a good girl. Hark how she answers you,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked a few steps, and Kate called again, &ldquo;Philip!&rdquo; There was no
      answer. &ldquo;Philip is stubborn; he won't have anything to do with me,&rdquo; said
      Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Philip called a second time, &ldquo;Katey!&rdquo; And back came the echo as
      before. &ldquo;Well, that's too bad. Katey is&mdash;yes, she's actually <i>following</i>
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip's courage oozed out of him. &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; he thought. <i>Traa-dy-liooar</i>&mdash;time
      enough. &ldquo;After supper, when everybody is going! Outside the mill, in the
      half light of candles within and darkness without! It will sound so
      ordinary then, 'Good-bye! Haven't you heard the news? Auntie Nan is
      reconciled at last to leaving Ballure and joining me in Douglas.' That's
      it; so simple, so commonplace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The light was now coming between the trees on the closing west in long
      swords of sunset red. They could hear the jolting of the laden cart on its
      way down the glen. The birds were fairly rioting overhead, and all sorts
      of joyous sounds filled the air. Underfoot there were long ferns and
      gorse, which caught at her crinkling dress sometimes, and then he
      liberated her and they laughed. A trailing bough of deadly nightshade was
      hanging from the broken head of an old ash stump, whose wasted feet were
      overgrown by two scarlet-tipped toadstools, and she plucked a long tendril
      of it and wound it about her head, tipping her sun-bonnet back, and
      letting the red berries droop over her dark hair to her face. Then she
      began to sing,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     O were I monarch o' the globe,
     Wi' thee to reign, wi' thee to reign.
</pre>
    <p>
      Radiant gleams shot out of her black pupils, and flashes of love like
      lightning passed from her eye to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he tried to moralise. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, out of the gravity of his
      wisdom, &ldquo;if one could only go on for ever like this, living from minute to
      minute! But that's the difference between a man and a woman. A woman lives
      in the world of her own heart. If she has interests, they centre there.
      But a man has his interests outside his affections. He is compelled to
      deny himself, to let the sweetest things go by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate began to laugh, and Philip ended by laughing too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;only look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the top of the bank above them a goat was skirmishing. He was a
      ridiculous fellow; sometimes cropping with saucy jerks, then kicking up
      his heels, as if an invisible imp had pinched him, then wagging his rump
      and laughing in his nostrils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I was saying,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;a man has to put by the pleasures of
      life. Now here's myself, for example. I am bound, do you know, by a kind
      of duty&mdash;a sort of vow made to the dead, I might say&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure he's going to say something,&rdquo; thought Kate. The voice of his
      heart was speaking louder and quicker than his halting tongue. She saw
      that a blow was coming, and looked about for the means to ward it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fairy's dubb!&rdquo; she cried suddenly, and darted from his side to the
      water's edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a little round pool, black as ink, lying quiet and apparently
      motionless under a noisy place where the waters swirled and churned over
      black moss, and the stream ran into the dark. Philip had no choice but to
      follow her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut me a willow! Your penknife! Quick, sir, quick! Not that old branch&mdash;a
      sapling. There, that's it. Now you shall hear me tell my own fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An ordeal is it?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Be quiet, still, or little Phonodoree wont listen. Hush, now hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With solemn airs, but a certain sparkle in her eyes, she went down on her
      knees by the pool, stretched her round arm over the water, passed the
      willow bough slowly across its surface, and recited her incantation:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Willow bough, willow bough, which of the four,
     Sink, circle, or swim, or come floating ashore?
     Which is the fortune you keep for my life,
     Old maid or young mistress or widow or wife?
</pre>
    <p>
      With the last word she flung the willow bough on to the pool, and sat back
      on her heels to watch it as it moved slowly with the motion of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; cried Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet. It's swimming. No, it's coming ashore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's wife, Kate. No, it's widow. No, it's&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do be serious. Oh, dear! it's going&mdash;yes, it's going round. Not that
      either. No, it has&mdash;yes, it has&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sunk!&rdquo; said Philip, laughing and clapping his hands. &ldquo;You're doomed to be
      an old maid, Kate. Phonodoree says so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cruel Brownie! I'm vexed that I bothered with him,&rdquo; said Kate, dropping
      her lip. Then nodding to her reflection in the water where the willow
      bough had disappeared, she said, &ldquo;Poor little Katey! He might have given
      you something else. Anything but that dear, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; laughed Philip, &ldquo;crying? Because Phonodoree&mdash;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate leapt up with averted face. &ldquo;What nonsense you are talking!&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are tears in your eyes, though,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder, either. You're so ridiculous. And if I'm meant for an old
      maid, you're meant for an old bachelor&mdash;and quite right too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed. You've got no more heart than a mushroom, for you're all
      head and legs, and you're going to be just as bald some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, am I, mistress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were you, Philip, I should hire myself out for a scarecrow, and then
      having nothing under your clothes wouldn't so much matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn't, wouldn't it?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was shying off at a half circle; he was beating round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you're nearly as old as Methuselah already, and what you'll be when
      you're a man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lookout!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made him an arch curtsey and leapt round a tree, and cried from the
      other side, &ldquo;I know. A squeaking old croaker, with the usual old song,
      'Deed yes, friends, this world is a vale of sin and misery.' The men's the
      misery and the women's the sin&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You rogue, you!&rdquo; cried Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made after her, and she fled, still speaking, &ldquo;What do you think a girl
      wants with a&mdash;&mdash;Oh! Oh! Oo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her tirade ended suddenly. She had plunged into a bed of the prickly
      gorse, and was feeling in twenty places at once what it was to wear low
      shoes and thin stockings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a Samson, eh?&rdquo; cried Philip, striding on in his riding breeches, and
      lifting the captured creature in his arms. &ldquo;Why, to carry her, you
      torment, to carry her through the gorse like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, turning her face over his shoulder, and tickling his neck
      with her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hair caught in a tree, and fell in a dark shower over his breast. He
      set her on her feet; they took hands, and went carolling down the glen
      together:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The brightest jewel in my crown, Wad be my queen, wad be my queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The daylight lingered as if loth to leave them. There was the fluttering
      of wings overhead, and sometimes the last piping of birds. The wind
      wandered away, and left their voices sovereign of all the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there came a distant shout; the cheer of the farm people on reaching
      home with the Melliah.. It awakened Philip as from a fit of intoxication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is madness,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;What am I doing?&rdquo; &ldquo;He is going to speak
      now,&rdquo; she told herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her gaiety shaded off into melancholy, and her melancholy burst into wild
      gaiety again. The night had come down, the moon had risen, the stars had
      appeared. She crept closer to Philip's side, and began to tell him the
      story of a witch. They were near to the house the witch had lived in.
      There it was&mdash;that roofless cottage&mdash;that tholthan under the
      deep trees like a dungeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never heard of her, Philip? No? The one they called the
      Deemster's lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Deemster?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This one, Deemster Mylrea, who is said to be dying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dying; he is killing himself; I saw him to-day,' said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, she was the blacksmith's daughter, and he left her, and she went
      mad and cursed him, and said she was his wife though they hadn't been to
      church, and he should never marry anybody else. Then her father turned her
      out, and she came up here all alone, and there was a baby, and they were
      saying she killed it, and everybody was afraid of her. And all the time
      her boy was making himself a great, great man until he got to be Deemster.
      But he never married, never, though times and times people were putting
      this lady on him and then that; but when they told the witch, she only
      laughed and said, 'Let him, he'll get lave enough!' At last she was old
      and going on two sticks, and like to die any day, and then he crept out of
      his big house unknown to any one and stole up here to the woman's cottage.
      And when she saw the old man she said, 'So you've come at last, boy; but
      you've been keeping me long, bogh, you've been keeping me long.' And then
      she died. Wasn't that strange?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her dark eyes looked up at him and her mouth quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it witchcraft, then?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; it was only because he was her husband. That was the hold she had
      of him. He was tempted away by a big house and a big name, but he <i>had</i>
      to come back to her. And it's the same with a woman. Once a girl is the
      wife of somebody, she <i>must</i> cling to him, and if she is ever false
      she must return. Something compels her. That's if she's really his wife&mdash;really,
      truly. How beautiful, isn't it? Isn't it beautiful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that, Kate? Do you think a man, like a woman, would cling
      the closer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He couldn't help himself, Philip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip tried to say it was only a girl's morality, but her confidence
      shamed him. She slipped her moist fingers into his hand again. They were
      close by the deserted tholthan, and she was creeping nearer and nearer to
      his side. A bat swirled above their heads and she made a faint cry. Then a
      cat shot from under a gooseberry bush, and she gave a little scream. She
      was breathing irregularly. He could smell the perfume of her fallen hair.
      He was in agony of pain and delight. His heart was leaping in his bosom;
      his eyes were burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's right,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Love is best. It is everything. It is the
      crown of life. Shall I give it up for the Dead Sea fruit of worldly
      success? Think of the Deemster! Wifeless, childless, living solitary,
      dying alone, unregretled, unmourned. What is the wickedness you are
      plotting? Your father is dead, you can do him neither good nor harm. This
      girl is alive. She loves you. Love her. Let the canting hypocrites prate
      as they will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had disengaged her hand, and was creeping away from him in the half
      darkness, treading softly and going off like a gleam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate!&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard her laughter, he heard the drowsy hum of the gill, he could smell
      the warm odour of the gorse bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is madness,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;This is the fever of an hour. Yield
      now and I am ruined for life. The girl has come between me and my aims, my
      vows, my work&mdash;everything. She has tempted me, and I am as weak as
      water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here this moment, Kate. I have something to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bite!&rdquo; she said, coming back and holding an apple to his lips. She had
      plucked it in the overgrown garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen! I'm leaving Ramsey for good&mdash;don't intend to practise in the
      northern courts any longer&mdash;settling in Douglas&mdash;best work lies
      there, you see&mdash;worst of it is&mdash;we shan't meet again soon&mdash;not
      very soon, you know&mdash;not for years, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began by stammering, and went on stuttering, blurting out his words,
      and trembling at the sound of his own voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip, you must not go!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I'm sorry, Kate, very sorry. Shall
      always remember so tenderly&mdash;not to say fondly&mdash;the happy boy
      and girl days together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip, Philip, you must not go&mdash;you cannot go&mdash;you shall not
      go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could see her bosom heaving under her loose red bodice. She took hold
      of his arm and dragged at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you spare me? Will you shame me to death? Must I tell you? If you
      won't speak, I will. You cannot leave me, Philip, because&mdash;because&mdash;what
      do I care?&mdash;because I love you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't say that, Kate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you, Philip&mdash;I love you&mdash;I love you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to God I had never been born!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I will show you how sweet it is to be alive. Take me, take me&mdash;I
      am yours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her upturned face seemed to flash. He staggered like one seized with
      giddiness. It was a thing of terror to behold her. Still he struggled.
      &ldquo;Though apart, we shall remember each other, Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to remember. I want to have you with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our hearts will always be together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to me then, Philip, come to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The purest part of our hearts&mdash;our souls&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want <i>you!</i> Will you drive a girl to shame herself again? I
      want <i>you</i>, Philip! I want your eyes that I may see them every day;
      and your hair, that I may feel it with my hands; and your lips&mdash;can I
      help it?&mdash;yes, and your lips, that I may kiss and kiss them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate! Kate! Turn your eyes away. Don't look at me like that!&rdquo; She was
      fighting for her life. It was to be now or never.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you won't come to me, I'll go to you!&rdquo; she cried; and then she sprang
      upon him, and all grew confused, the berries of the nightshade whipped his
      forehead, and the moon and the stars went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love! My darling! My girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't go now?&rdquo; she sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forgive me, I cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me. I feel your heart beating. You are mine&mdash;mine&mdash;mine!
      Say you won't go now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forgive us both!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me again, Philip! Don't despise me that I love you better than
      myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was weeping, she was laughing, her heart was throbbing up to her
      throat. At the next moment she had broken from his embrace and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate! Kate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice came from the tholthan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When a good woman falls from honour, is it merely that she is a victim of
      momentary intoxication, of stress of passion, of the fever of instinct?
      No. It is mainly that she is a slave of the sweetest, tenderest, most
      spiritual and pathetic of all human fallacies&mdash;the fallacy that by
      giving herself to the man she loves she attaches him to herself for ever.
      This is the real betrayer of nearly all good women that are betrayed. It
      lies at the root of tens of thousands of the cases that make up the
      merciless story of man's sin and woman's weakness. Alas! it is only the
      woman who clings the closer. The impulse of the man is to draw apart. He
      must conquer it or she is lost. Such is the old cruel difference and
      inequality of man and woman as nature made them&mdash;the old trick, the
      old tragedy.

    <h2>
      XXIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Old Mannanin, the magician, according to his wont, had surrounded his
      island with mist that day, and, in the helpless void of things unrevealed,
      a steamship bound for Liverpool came with engines slacked some points
      north of her course, blowing her fog-horn over the breathless sea with
      that unearthly yell which must surely be the sound whereby the devil
      summons his legions out of chaos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently something dropping through the dense air settled for a moment on
      the damp rope of the companion ladder, and one of the passengers
      recognised it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gough! It's a bird, a sparrow,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment there was a rustle of wind, the mist lifted, and a
      great round shoulder rose through the white gauze, as if it had been the
      ghost of a mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the Isle of Man,&rdquo; the passenger shouted, and there was a cry of
      incredulity. &ldquo;It's the Calf, I'm telling you, boys. Lave it to me to
      know.&rdquo; And instantly the engines were reversed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passenger, a stalwart fellow, with a look as of pallor under a tawny
      tan, walked the deck in a fever of excitement, sometimes shouting in a
      cracked voice, sometimes laughing huskily, and at last breaking down in a
      hoarse gurgle like a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you put me ashore, capt'n?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry I can't, sir, we've lost time already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a dog with him, a little, misshappen, ugly creature, and he
      lifted it up in his arms and hugged it, and called it by blusterous swear
      names, with noises of inarticulate affection. Then he went down to his
      berth in the second cabin and opened a little box of letters, and took
      them out one by one, and leaned up to the port to read them. He had read
      them before, and he knew them by heart, but he traced the lines with his
      broad forefinger, and spelled the words one by one. And as he did so he
      laughed aloud, and then cried to himself, and then laughed once more. &ldquo;She
      is well and happy, and looking lovely, and, if she does not write, don't
      think she is forgetting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless her. And God bless him, too. God bless them both!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went up on deck again, for he could not rest in one place long. There
      was a breeze now, and he filled his lungs and blew and blew. The island
      was dying down over the sea in a pale light of silver grey. An engineman
      and a stoker were leaning over the bulwark to cool themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy enough now, sir, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy as a sand-boy, mate, only mortal hungry. Tiffin you say? Aw, the
      heart has its hunger same as anything else, and mine has been on short
      commons these five years and better. See that island there, lying like a
      salmon gull atop of the water? Looks as if she might dip under it, doesn't
      she? That's my home, my native land, as the man says, and only three weeks
      ago I wasn't looking to see the thundering ould thing again; but God is
      good, you see, and I am middling fit for all. I'm a Manxman myself, mate,
      and I've got a lil Manx woman that's waiting for me yonder. It's only an
      ould shirt I'm bringing her to patch, as the saying is, but she'll be that
      joyful you never seen. It's bad to take a woman by surprise, though&mdash;these
      nervous creatures&mdash;'sterics, you see&mdash;I'll send her a tally
      graph from the Stage. My sakes! the joy she'll be taking of that boy, too!
      He'll be getting sixpence for himself and a drink of butter-milk. It's
      always the way of these poor lil things&mdash;can't stand no good news at
      all&mdash;people coming home and the like&mdash;not much worth, these
      women&mdash;crying reglar&mdash;can't help it. Well, you see, they're
      tender-hearteder than us, and when anybody's been five years... Be gough,
      we're making way, though! The island's going under, for sure. Or is it my
      eyes that isn't so clear since my bit of a bullet-wound! Aw, God is good,
      tremen-jous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The breaking voice stopped suddenly, and the engine-men turned about, but
      the passenger was stumbling down the cabin stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ever a man came back from the dead it's that one,&rdquo; said both men
      together.

    <h2>
      I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Philip was vanquished, and he knew it, but he was not daunted, he was not
      distressed. To have resisted the self-abandonment of Kate's love would
      have been monstrous. Therefore, he had done no wrong, and there was
      nothing to be ashamed of. But when he reached Ballure he did not dash into
      Auntie Nan's room, according to his wont, though a light was burning
      there, and he could hear the plop and click of thread and needle; he crept
      upstairs to his own, and sat down to write a letter. It was the first of
      his love letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall count the days, the hours, and the minutes until we meet again,
      my darling, and I shall be constantly asking what time it is. And seeing
      we must be so much apart, let us contrive a means of being together,
      nevertheless. Listen!&mdash;I whisper the secret in your ear. To-morrow
      night and every night eat your supper at eight o'clock exactly; I will do
      the same, and so we shall be supping in each other's company, my little
      wife, though twenty miles divide us. If any body asks me to supper, I will
      refuse in order that I may sup with you. 'I am promised to a friend,' I'll
      say, and then I'll sit down in my rooms alone, but you will be with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tingling with delight, he wrote this letter to Kate, though less than an
      hour parted from her, and went out to post it. He was going upstairs
      again, steadily, on tiptoe, his head half aside and his face over his
      shoulder, when Auntie Nan's voice came from the blue room&mdash;&ldquo;Philip!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned with a sheepish look, and a sense, never felt before, of being
      naked, so to speak. But Auntie Nan did not look at him. She was working a
      lamb on a sampler, and she reached over the frame to take something out of
      a drawer and hand it to him. It was a medallion of a young child&mdash;a
      boy, with long fair curls like a girl's, and a face like sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it father, Auntie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; a French painter who came ashore with Thurlot painted it for
      grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip laid it on the table. He was more than ever sure that Auntie Nan
      had heard something. Such were her tender ways of warning him. He could
      not be vexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sleepy to-night, Auntie, and you look tired too. You've been waiting
      up for me again. Now, you really must not. Besides, it limits one's
      freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's nothing, Philip. You said you would come home after calling on the
      poor Deemster, and so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's in a bad way, Auntie. Drink&mdash;delirium&mdash;such a wreck. Well,
      good night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you read the letters, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. Father's letters. Yes, I read them. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't they beautiful? Haven't they the very breath of ambition and
      enthusiasm? But poor father! How soon the brightness melted away! He never
      repined, though. Oh, no, never. Indeed, he used to laugh and joke at our
      dreams and our castles in the air. 'You must do it all yourself, Nannie;
      you shall have all the cakes and ale.' Yes, when he was a dying man he
      would joke like that. But sometimes he would grow serious, and then he
      would say, 'Give little Philip some for all. He'll deserve it more than
      me. Oh, God,' he would say, 'let me think to myself when I'm <i>there</i>,
      you've missed the good things of life, but your son has got them; you are
      here, but he is on the heights; lie still, thou poor aspiring heart, lie
      still in your grave and rest.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip felt like a bird struggling in the meshes of a net.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father was a poet, Auntie, trying to be a man of the world. That was
      the real mischief in his life, if you think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Auntie Nan looked up with her needle at poise above the sampler, and said
      in a nervous voice, &ldquo;The real mischief of your father's life, Philip, was
      love&mdash;what they call love. But love is not that. Love is peace and
      virtue, and right living, and that is only madness and frenzy, and when
      people wake up from it they wake up as from a nightmare. Men talk of it as
      a holy thing&mdash;it is unholy. Books are written in praise of it&mdash;I
      would have such books burnt. When anybody falls to it, he is like a blind
      man who has lost his guide, tottering straight to the precipice. Women
      fall to it too. Yes, good women as well as good men; I have seen them
      tempted&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was certain of it now. Some one had been prying upon him at Sulby.
      He was angry, and his anger spent itself on Auntie Nan in a torrent of
      words. &ldquo;You are wrong, Aunt Anne, quite wrong. Love is the one lovely
      thing in life. It is beauty, it is poetry. Call it passion if you will&mdash;what
      would the world be like without it? A place where every human heart would
      be an island standing alone; a place without children, without joy,
      without merriment, without laughter. No, no; Heaven has given us love, and
      we are wrong when we try to put it away. We cannot put it away, and when
      we make the attempt we are punished for our pride and arrogance. It ought
      to be enough for us to let heaven decide whether we are to be great men or
      little men, and to decide for ourselves whether we are to be good men and
      happy men. And the greatest happiness of life is love. Heaven would have
      to work a miracle to enable us to live without it. But Heaven does not
      work such a miracle, because the greatest miracle of heaven is love
      itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The needle hand of Auntie Nan was trembling above her sampler, and her
      lips were twitching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a young man yet, Philip,&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;but I am an old lady
      now, dear, and I have seen the fruits of the intoxication you call
      passion. Oh, have I not, have I not? It wrecks lives, ruins prospects,
      breaks up homes, sets father against son, and brother against brother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip would give her no chance. He was tramping across the room, and he
      burst out with, &ldquo;You are wrong again, Auntie. You are always wrong in
      these matters, because you are always thinking from the particular to the
      general&mdash;you are always thinking of my father. What you have been
      calling my father's fall was really his fate. He deserved it. If he had
      been fit for the high destiny he aspired to&mdash;if he had been fit to be
      a judge, he would not have fallen. That he did fall is proof enough that
      he was not fit. God did not intend it. My father's aspirations were not
      the call of a stern vocation, they were mere poetic ambition. If he had
      ever by great ill-fortune lived to be made Deemster, he would have found
      himself out, and the island would have found him out, and you yourself
      would have found him out, and all the world would have been undeceived. As
      a poet he might have been a great man, but as a Deemster he must have been
      a mockery, a hypocrite, an impostor, and a sham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Auntie Nan rose to her feet with a look of fright on her sweet old face,
      and something dropped with a clank on to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Philip, Philip, if I thought you could ever repeat the error&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Philip gave her no time to finish. Tossing his disordered hair from
      his forehead, he swung out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being alone, he began to collect himself. Was it, in sober fact, he who
      had spoken like that? Of his father too? To Auntie Nan as well? He saw how
      it was; he had been speaking of his father, but he had been thinking of
      himself; he had been struggling to justify himself, to reconcile,
      strengthen, and fortify himself. But in doing so he had been breaking an
      idol, a life-long idol, his own idol and Auntie Nan's.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stumbled downstairs in a rush of remorse, and burst again into the room
      crying in a broken voice, &ldquo;Auntie! Auntie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the room was empty; the lamp was turned down; the sampler was pushed
      aside. Something crunched under his foot, and he stooped and picked it up.
      It was the medallion, and it was cracked across. The accident terrified
      him. His skin seemed to creep. He felt as if he had trodden on his
      father's face. Putting the broken picture into his pocket, he turned about
      like a guilty man and crept silently to bed in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the morning brought him solace for the pains of the night&mdash;it
      brought him a letter from Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Melliah is over at long, long last, and I am allowed to be alone with
      my thoughts. They sang 'Keerie fu Snaighty' after you left, and 'The King
      can only love his wife, And I can do the sa-a-me, And I can do the same.'
      But there is really nothing to tell you, for nothing happened of the
      slightest consequence. Good night! I am going to bed after I have posted
      this letter at the bridge. Two hours hence you will appear to me in sleep,
      unless I lie that long awake to think of you. I generally do. Good-bye, my
      dear lord and master! You will let me know what you think best to be done.
      Your difficulties alarm me terribly. You see, dear, we two are about to do
      something so much out of the common. Good night! I lift my head that you
      may give me another kiss on the eyes, and here are two for yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there were empty brackets [ ], which Kate had put her lips to,
      expecting Philip to do the same.

      II.

    <p>
      Philip was going into his chambers in Douglas that morning when he came
      upon a messenger from Government House in stately intercourse with his
      servant. His Excellency begged him to step up to Onchan immediately, and
      to remain for lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor's carriage was at the door, and Philip got into it. He was
      not excited; he remembered his agitation at the Governor's former message
      and smiled. On leaving his own rooms he had not forgotten to order supper
      for eight o'clock precisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the Governor polite and expansive as usual. He was sitting in a
      room hung round with ponderous portraits of former Governors, most of them
      in frills and ruffles, and one vast picture of King George.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have heard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that our northern Deemster is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he so?&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;I saw him at one o'clock yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He died at two?&rdquo; said the Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor man, poor man!&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all. Not a tremble of the eyelid, not a quiver of the lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are aware that the office is a Crown appointment?&rdquo; said the Governor.
      &ldquo;Applications are made, you know, to the Home Office, but it is probable
      that my advice may be asked by the Secretary in his selection. I may,
      perhaps, be of use to a candidate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip gave no sign, and the Governor shifted his leg and continued with a
      smile, &ldquo;Certainly that appears to be the impression of your brother
      advocates, Mr. Christian; they are about me already, like wasps at a
      glue-pot. I will not question but you'll soon be one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip made a gesture of protestation, and the Governor waved his hand and
      smiled again. &ldquo;Oh, I shan't blame you; young men are ambitious. It is
      natural that they should wish to advance themselves in life. In your case,
      too, if I may say so, there is the further spur of a desire to recover the
      position your family once held, and lately lost through the mistake or
      misfortune of your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip bowed gravely, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, no doubt,&rdquo; said the Governor, &ldquo;would be a fact in your favour. The
      great fact against you would be that you are still so young. Let me see,
      is it eight-and twenty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-six,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more? Only six-and-twenty? And then, successful as your career has
      been thus far&mdash;perhaps I should say distinguished or even brilliant&mdash;you
      are still unsettled in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip asked if his Excellency meant that he was still unmarried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I do,&rdquo; the Governor replied, with pretended severity, &ldquo;and if I
      do, don't smile too broadly, young man. You ought to know by this time
      that the personal equation counts for something in this old-fashioned
      island of yours. Now, the late Deemster was an example which it would be
      perilous to repeat. If it were repeated, I know who would hear of the
      blunder every day of his life, and it wouldn't be the Home Secretary
      either. Deemster Mylrea was called upon to punish the crimes of drink, and
      he was himself a drunkard; to try the offences of sensuality, and he was
      himself a sensualist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip could not help it&mdash;he gave a little crack of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said the Governor hastily, &ldquo;you are in no danger of his
      excesses; but you will not be a safe candidate to recommend until you have
      placed yourself to all appearances out of the reach of them. 'Beware of
      these Christians,' said the great Derby to his son; and pardon me if I
      revive the warning to a Christian himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colour came strong into Philip's face. Even at that moment he felt
      angry at so coarse a version of his father's fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that we are apt to marry unwisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do that,&rdquo; said the Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no telling,&rdquo; said Philip, with a faint crack of his fingers; and
      the Governor frowned a little&mdash;the pock-marks seemed to spread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, all this is outside my duty, Mr. Christian&mdash;I needn't
      tell you that; but I feel an interest in you, and I've done you some
      services already, though naturally a young man will think he has done
      everything for himself. Ah!&rdquo; he said, rising from his seat at the sound of
      a gong, &ldquo;luncheon is ready. Let us join the ladies.&rdquo; Then, with one hand
      on Philip's shoulder familiarly, &ldquo;only a word more, Mr. Christian. Send in
      your application immediately, and&mdash;take the advice of an old fiddler&mdash;marry
      as soon afterwards as may be. But with your prospects it would be a sin
      not to walk carefully. If she's English, so much the better; but if she's
      Manx&mdash;take care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip lunched with the Governor's wife, who told him she remembered his
      grandfather; also with his unmarried daughter, who said she had heard him
      speak for the fishermen at Peel. An official &ldquo;At home,&rdquo; the last of the
      summer, was to be held in the garden that afternoon, and Philip was
      invited to remain. He did so, and thereby witnessed the assaults of the
      wasps at the glue-pot. They buzzed about the Governor, they buzzed about
      his wife, they buzzed about his dog and about a tame deer, which took
      grapes from the hands of the guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      An elderly gentleman, sitting alone in a carriage, drove up to the lawn.
      It was Peter Christian Ballawhaine, looking feebler, whiter, and more
      splay-footed than before. Philip stepped up to his uncle and offered his
      arm to alight by. But the Ballawhaine brushed it aside and pushed through
      to the Governor, to whom he talked incessantly for some minutes of his son
      Ross, saying he had sent for him and would like to present him to his
      Excellency.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Philip lacked enjoyment of the scene, if his face lacked heart and
      happiness, it was not the fault of his host. &ldquo;Will you not take Lady
      So-and-so to have tea?&rdquo; the Governor would say; and presently Philip found
      himself in a circle of official wifedom, whose husbands had been made
      Knights by the Queen, and themselves made Ladies by&mdash;God knows whom.
      The talk was of the late Deemster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a life! It's a mercy he lasted so long!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pity, you mean, my dear, not to be hard on him either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing! He ought to have married. Such a man wants a wife to look
      after him. Don't you think so, Mr. Christian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said a white-haired dame, &ldquo;have you never heard of his great
      romance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! tell us of that. Who was the lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; there was a pause; the white-haired dame coughed,
      smiled, closed her little ferret eyes, dropped her voice, and said with
      mock gravity, &ldquo;The lady was the blacksmith's daughter, dearest.&rdquo; And then
      there was a merry trill of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip felt sick, bowed to his hosts, and left. As he was going off, his
      uncle intercepted him, holding out both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's this, Philip? You never come to Ballawhaine now. I see! Oh, I see!
      Too busy with the women to remember an old man. They're all talking of
      you. Putting the comather on them, eh? I know, I know; don't tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Philip's way home lay through the town, but he made a circuit of the
      country, across Onchan, so heartsick was he, so utterly choked with bitter
      feelings. He felt as if all the angels and devils together must be making
      a mock at him. The thing he had worked for through five heavy years, the
      end he had aimed at, the goal he had fought for, was his already&mdash;his
      for the stretching out of his hand. Yet now that it was his, he could not
      have it. Oh, the mockery of his fate! Oh, the irony of his life! It was
      shrieking, it was frantic!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his bolder spirit seemed to say, &ldquo;What is all this childish fuming
      about? Fortune comes to you with both hands full. Be bold, and you may
      have both the wish of your soul and the desire of your heart&mdash;both
      the Deemster-ship and Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to believe that. If he married Kate, the Governor would
      not recommend him as Deemster. Had he not admitted that he stood in some
      fear of the public opinion of the island? And was it not conceivable that,
      besides the unselfish interest which the Governor had shown in him, there
      was even a personal one that would operate more powerfully than fear of
      the old-fashioned Manx conventions to prevent any recommendation of the
      husband of the wrong woman? At one moment a vague memory rose before
      Philip, as he crossed the fields, of the lunch at Government House, of the
      Governor's wife and daughter, of their courtesy and boundless
      graciousness. At the next moment he had drawn up sharply, with pangs of
      self-contempt, hating himself, loathing himself, swearing at himself for a
      mean-souled ingrate, as he kicked up the grass and the turf beneath it But
      the idea had taken root. He could not help it; the Governor's interest
      went for nothing in his reckoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fool you are, Philip,&rdquo; something seemed to whisper out of the
      darkest corner of his conscience; &ldquo;take the Deemstership first, and marry
      Kate afterwards.&rdquo; But it was impossible to think of that either. Say it
      could be done by any arts of cunning or duplicity, what then? Then there
      were the high walls of custom and prejudice to surmount. Philip remembered
      the garden-party, and saw that they could never be surmounted. The
      Deemster who slapped the conventions in the face would suffer for it. He
      would be taboo to half the life of the island&mdash;in public an official,
      in private a recluse. An icy picture rose before his mind's eye of the
      woman who would be his wife in her relations with the ladies he had just
      left. She might be their superior in education, certainly in all true
      manners, and in natural grace and beauty, in sweetness and charm, their
      mistress beyond a dream of comparison. But they would never forget that
      she was the daughter of a country innkeeper, and every little cobble in
      the rickety pyramid, even from the daughter of the innkeeper in the town,
      would look down on her as from a throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could see them leaving their cards at his door and driving hurriedly
      off. They must do that much. It was the bitter pill which the Deemster's
      doings made them swallow. Then he could see his wife sitting alone, a
      miserable woman, despised envied, isolated, shut off from her own class by
      her marriage with the Deemster, and from his class by the Deemster's
      marriage with her. Again, he could see himself too powerful to offend, too
      dangerous to ignore, going out on his duties without cheer, and returning
      to his wife without company. Finally, he remembered his father and his
      mother, and he could not help but picture himself sitting at home with
      Kate five years after their marriage, when the first happiness of each
      other's society had faded, had staled, had turned to the wretchedness of
      starvation in its state of siege. Or perhaps going out for walks with her,
      just themselves, always themselves only, they two together, this evening,
      last evening, and to-morrow evening; through the streets crowded by
      visitors, down the harbour where the fishermen congregate, across the
      bridge and over the head between sea and sky; people bowing to them
      respectfully, rigidly, freezingly; people nudging and whispering and
      looking their way. Oh, God, what end could come of such an abject life but
      that, beginning by being unhappy, they should descend to being bad as
      well?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fuss you are making of things,&rdquo; said the voice again, but more
      loudly. &ldquo;This hubbub only means that you can't have your cake and eat it.
      Very well, take Kate, and let the Deemstership go to perdition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was not much comfort in that counsel, for it made no reckoning with
      the certainty that, if marriage with Kate would prevent him from being
      Deemster, it would prevent him from being anything in the Isle of Man. As
      it had happened with his father, so it would happen with him&mdash;there
      would be no standing ground in the island for the man who had deliberately
      put himself outside the pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't worry me with silly efforts to draw a line so straight. If you
      can't have Kate and the Deemstership together, and if you can't have Kate
      without the Deemstership, there is only one thing left&mdash;the
      Deemstership without Kate. You must take the office and forego the girl.
      It is your duty, your necessity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was how Philip put it to himself at length, and the daylight had gone
      by that time, and he was walking in the dark. But the voice which had been
      pleading on his side now protested on hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't prate of duty and necessity. You mean self-love and self-interest.
      Man, be honest. Because this woman is an obstacle in your career, you
      would sacrifice her. It is boundless, pitiless selfishness. Suppose you
      abandon her, dare you think of her without shame! She loves you, she
      trusts you, and she has given you proof of her love and trust. Hold your
      tongue. Don't dare to whisper that nobody knows it but you and heir&mdash;that
      you will be silent, that she will have no temptation to speak. She loves
      you. She has given you all. God bless her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Affectionate pity swept down the selfish man in him. As the lights of the
      town appeared on his path, he was saying to himself boldly, &ldquo;Since either
      way there is trouble, I'll do as I said last night&mdash;I'll leave Heaven
      to decide whether I'm to be a great man or a little man, and decide for
      myself whether I'm to be a true man or a happy man. I'll take my heart in
      my hand and go right forward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this temper he returned to his chambers. The rooms fronted to Athol
      Street, but backed on to the churchyard of St. George's. They were quiet,
      and not overlooked. His lamp was lit. The servant was laying the cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lay covers for two, Jemmy,&rdquo; said Philip. Then he began to hum something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, in feeling for his keys, his fingers touched an unfamiliar
      substance in his pocket. He remembered what it was. It was the cracked
      medallion of his father. He could not bear to look at it. Unlocking a
      chest, he buried it at the bottom under a pile of winter clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This recalled a possession yet more painful, and going to a desk, he drew
      out the packet of his father's letters and proceeded to hide them away
      with the medallion. As he did so his hand trembled, his limbs shook, he
      felt giddy, and he thought the voice that had tormented him with
      conflicting taunts was ringing in his ears again. &ldquo;Bury him deep! Bury
      your father out of all sight and all remembrance. Bury his love of you,
      his hopes of you, his expectations and dreams of you. Bury and forget him
      for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip hesitated a moment, and then banged down the lid of the chest, and
      relocked it as his servant returned to the room. The man was a solemn,
      dignified, and reticent person, who had been groom to the late Bishop. His
      gravity he had acquired from his horses, his dignity from his master; but
      his reticence he had created for himself, being a thing beyond nature in
      creature or man. His proper name was Cottier; he had always been known as
      Jemy-Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Company not arrived, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Wait or serve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the time?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Struck eight; but clock two minutes soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serve the supper at once,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the dishes had been brought in and the man dismissed, Philip, taking
      his place at the table, drew from his button-hole a flower which he had
      picked out of his water-bowl at lunch, and, first putting it to his lips,
      he tossed it on to the empty place before the chair which had been drawn
      up opposite. Then he sat down to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ate little; and, do what he would, he could not keep his mind from
      wandering. He thought of his aunt, and how hurt she had been the previous
      night; of his uncle, and how he had snubbed and then slavered over him; of
      the Governor, and how strange the interest he had shown in him; and
      finally, he thought of Pete, and how lately he was dead, and how soon
      forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of these memories, all sad and some bitter, suddenly he
      remembered again that he was supping with Kate. Then he struggled to be
      bright and even a little gay. He knew that she would be taking her supper
      at Sulby at that moment, thinking of him and making believe that he was
      with her. So he tried to think that she was with him, sitting in the chair
      opposite, looking across the table between the white cloth and the blue
      lamp-shade, out of her beaming eyes, with her rings of dark hair dancing
      on her forehead, and her ripe mouth twitching merrily. Then the air of the
      room seemed to be filled with a sweet presence. He could have fancied
      there was a perfume of lace and dainty things. &ldquo;Sweetheart!&rdquo; He laughed&mdash;he
      hardly knew if it was himself that had spoken. It was dear, delicious
      fooling.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his eyes fell on the chest wherein he had buried the letters and the
      medallion, and his mind wandered again. He thought of his father, of his
      grandfather, of his lost inheritance, and how nearly he had reclaimed the
      better part of it, and then once more of Pete, crying aloud at last in the
      coil of his trouble, &ldquo;Oh, if Pete had only lived!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice startled and his words horrified him. To wipe out both in the
      first moment of recovered consciousness, he filled his glass to the brim,
      and lifted it up, rising at the same time, looking across the table, and
      saying in a soft whisper, &ldquo;Your health, darling, your health!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bell rang from the street door, and he stood listening with the
      wine-glass in his hand. When he knew anything more, a voice at his elbow
      was saying out of a palpitating gloom, &ldquo;The gentleman can't come,
      seemingly; he has sent a telegram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Jem-y-Lord holding a telegram in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip tore open the envelope and read&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming home by Ramsey boat to-morrow well and hearty tell Kirry Peat.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Somewhere in the dead and vacant dawn Philip went to bed, worn out by a
      night-long perambulation of the dark streets. He slept a heavy sleep of
      four deep hours, with oppressive dreams of common things swelling to
      enormous size about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jem-y-Lord took the tea to his master's bedroom in the morning, the
      tray was almost banged out of his hands by the clashing back of the door,
      after he had pushed it open with his knee. The window was half up, and a
      cold sea-breeze was blowing into the room; yet the grate and hearth showed
      that a fire had been kindled in the night, and his master was still
      sleeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jem set down his tray, lifted a decanter that stood on the table, held it
      to the light, snorted like an old horse, nodded to himself knowingly, and
      closed the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip awoke with the noise, and looked around in a bewildered way. He was
      feeling vaguely that something had happened, when the man said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horse will be round soon, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What horse?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horse you ride, sir,&rdquo; said Jem, and, with an indulgent smile, he
      added, &ldquo;the one I ordered from Shimmen's when I posted the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letter you gave me to post before I went to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All was jumbled and confused in Philip's mind. He was obliged to make an
      effort to remember. Just then the newsboys went shouting down the street
      beyond the churchyard: &ldquo;Special edition&mdash;Death of the Deemster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then everything came back. He had written to Kate, asking her to meet him
      at Port Mooar at two o'clock that day. It was then, and in that lonesome
      place, that he had decided to break the news to her. He must tell all; he
      had determined upon his course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without appetite he ate his breakfast. As he did so he heard voices from a
      stable-yard in the street. He lifted his head and looked out mechanically.
      A four-wheeled dogcart was coming down the archway behind a mettlesome
      young horse with silver-mounted harness. The man driving it was a gorgeous
      person in a light Melton overcoat. One of his spatted feet was on the
      break, and he had a big cigar between his teeth. It was Ross Christian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last time Philip had seen the man he had fought him for the honour of
      Kate. It was like whips and scorpions to think of that now. Ashamed,
      abased, degraded in his own eyes, he turned away his head.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the middle of the night following the Melliah, Kate, turning in bed,
      kissed her hand because it had held the hand of Philip. When she awoke in
      the morning she felt a great happiness. Opening her eyes and half raising
      herself in bed, she looked around. There were the pink curtains hanging
      like a tent above her, there were the scraas of the thatched roof, with
      the cracking whitewash snipping down on the counterpane, there were the
      press and the wash-hand table, the sheep-skin on the floor, and the sun
      coming through the orchard window. But everything was transfigured,
      everything beautiful, everything mysterious. She was like one who had gone
      to sleep on the sea, with only the unattainable horizon round about, and
      awakened in harbour in a strange land that was warm and lovely and full of
      sunshine. She closed her eyes again, so that nothing might disturb the
      contemplation of the mystery. She folded her round arms as a pillow behind
      her head, her limbs dropped back of their own weight, and her mouth broke
      into a happy smile. Oh, miracle of miracles! The whole world was changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard the clatter of pattens in the room below; it was Nancy churning
      in the dairy. She heard shouts from beyond the orchard&mdash;it was her
      father stacking in the haggard; she heard her mother talking in the bar,
      and the mill-wheel swishing in the pond. It seemed almost wonderful that
      the machinery of ordinary life could be working away the same as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could she be the same herself? She reached over for a hand-glass to look
      at her face. As she took it off the table, it slipped from the tips of her
      fingers, and, falling face downwards, it broke. She had a momentary pang
      at that accident as at a bad omen, but just then Nancy came up with a
      letter. It was the letter which Philip had written at Ballure. When she
      was alone again she read it. Then she put it in her bosom. It seemed to be
      haunted by the odour of the gorse, the odour of the glen, of the tholthan,
      of Philip, and of all delights.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint ghost of shame came to frighten her. Had she sinned against her
      sex? Was it disgraceful that she had wooed and not waited to be won? With
      all his love of her, would Philip be ashamed of her also? Her face grew
      hot. She knew that she was blushing, and she covered up her head as if her
      lover were there to see. Such fears did not last long. Her joy was too
      bold to be afraid of tangible things. So overwhelming was her happiness
      that her only fear was lest she might awake at some moment and find that
      she was asleep now, and everything had been a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was Friday, and towards noon word came from Kirk Michael that the
      Deemster had died on the afternoon of the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they ought to put Philip Christian in his place,&rdquo; she said promptly;
      &ldquo;I'm sure no one deserves it better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had been talking in low tones in the kitchen with their backs to her,
      but faced about with looks of astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sakes alive, Kirry,&rdquo; cried Nancy, &ldquo;is it yourself it was? What were you
      saying a week ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, do you expect a girl to be saying the one thing always?&rdquo; laughed
      Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, no,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;A woman's opinions isn't usually as stiff as the
      tail of a fighting Tom cat. They're more coming and going, of a rule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day, Saturday, she received Philip's second letter, the letter
      written at Douglas after the supper and the arrival of Pete's telegram. It
      was written crosswise, in a hasty hand, on a half-sheet of note-paper, and
      was like a postscript, without signature or superscription:&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most urgent. Must see you immediately. Meet me at Port Mooar at two
      o'clock to-morrow. We can talk there without interruption. Be brave, my
      dear. There are serious matters to discuss and arrange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The message was curt, and even cold, but it brought her no disquiet.
      Marriage! That was the only vision it conjured up. The death of the
      Deemster had hastened things&mdash;that was the meaning of the urgency.
      Port Mooar was near to Ballure&mdash;that was why she had to go so far.
      They would have to face gossip, perhaps backbiting, perhaps even abuse&mdash;that
      was the reason she had to be brave. Why and how the Deemster's death
      should affect her marriage with Philip was a matter she did not puzzle
      out. She had vague memories of girls marrying in delightful haste and
      sailing away with their husbands, and being gone before you had time to
      think they were to go. But this new fact of her life was only a part of
      the great mystery, and was not to be explained by everyday ideas and
      occurrences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate ran up to dress, and came down like a bud bursting into flower. She
      had dressed more carefully than ever. Philip had great expectations; he
      must not be disappointed. Making the excuse of shopping, she was setting
      off towards Ramsey, when her father shouted from the stable that he was
      for driving the same way. The mare was harnessed to the gig, and they got
      up together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar had made inquiries and calculations. He had learned that the <i>Johannesburg</i>,
      from Cape Town, arrived in Liverpool the day before; and he concluded that
      Pete's effects would come by the <i>Peveril</i>, the weekly steamer to
      Ramsay, on Saturday morning, The <i>Peveril</i> left Liverpool at eight;
      she would be due at three. Cæsar meant to be on the quay at two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my duty as a parent, Kate,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What more natural but there's
      something for yourself? It's my duty as a pastor, too, for there's Manx
      ones going that's in danger of the devil of covetousness, and it's doing
      the Lord's work to put them out of the reach of temptation. You may exhort
      with them till you're black in the face, but it's throwing good money in
      the mud. Just <i>chuck!</i> No ring at all; no way responsive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate was silent, and Cæsar added familiarly, &ldquo;Of course, it's my right
      too, for when a man's birth is <i>that</i> way, there's no heirship by
      blood, and possession is nine points of the law. That's so, Kate. You
      needn't be looking so hard. It's truth enough, girl. I've had advocate's
      opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate had looked, but had not listened. The matter of her father's talk was
      too trivial, it's interest was too remote. As they drove, she kept
      glancing seaward and asking what time it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, time enough yet, woman,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;No need to be unaisy at all.
      She'll not be round the Head for an hour anyway. Will you come along with
      me to the quay, then? No? Well, better not, maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the door of a draper's she got down from the gig, and told her father
      not to wait for her on going home. Cæsar moistened his forefinger and held
      it in the air a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don't be late,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there's weather coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes afterwards she was walking rapidly up Ballure. Passing
      Ballure House, she found herself treading softly. It was like holy ground.
      She did not look across; she gave no sign; there was only a tremor of the
      eyelids, a quiver of the mouth, and a tightening of the hand that held her
      purse, as, with head down, she passed on. Going by the water-trough, she
      saw the bullet-head of Black Tom looking seaward over the hedge through a
      telescope encased in torn and faded cloth. Though the man was repugnant to
      her, she saluted him cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine day, Mr. Quilliam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>was</i> doing a fine day, ma'am, but the bees is coming home,&rdquo; said
      Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glowered at her as at a scout of the enemy, but she did not mind that.
      She was very happy. The sun was still shining. On reaching the top of the
      brow, she began to skip and run where the road descends by Folieu. Thus,
      with a light heart and a light step, thinking ill of no one, in love with
      all the world, she went hurrying to her doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sea below lay very calm and blue. Nothing was to be seen on the water
      but a line of black smoke from the funnel of a steamship which had not yet
      risen above the horizon.

    <h2>
      VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Philip put up his horse at the Hibernian, a mile farther on the high-road,
      and the tongue of the landlady, Mistress Looney went like a mill-race
      while he ate his dinner. She had known three generations of his family,
      and was full of stories of his grandfather, of his father, and of himself
      in his childhood. Full of facetiæ, too, about his looks, which were
      &ldquo;rasonable promising,&rdquo; and about the girls of Douglas, who were &ldquo;neither
      good nor middling.&rdquo; She was also full of sage counsel, advising marriage
      with a warm girl having &ldquo;nice things at her&mdash;nice lands and pigs and
      things&rdquo;&mdash;as a ready way to square the &ldquo;bobbery&rdquo; of thirty years ago
      at Ballawhaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip left his plate half full, and rose from the table to go down to
      Port Mooar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, boy veen, you've destroyed nothing,&rdquo;, cried the landlady. And then
      coaxingly, as if he had been a child, &ldquo;You'll be ateing bits for me, now,
      come, come! No more at all? Aw, it's failing you are, Mr. Philip! Going
      for a walk is it? Take your topcoat then, for the clover is closing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the road that Pete had haunted as a boy on returning home from
      school in the days when Kate lived at Cornaa, going through the network of
      paths by the mill, and over the brow by Ballajora. The new miller was
      pulling down the thatched cottage in which Kate had been born to put up a
      slate house. They had built a porch for shelter to the chapel, and carved
      the figure of a slaughtered lamb on a stone in the gable. Another lamb&mdash;a
      living lamb&mdash;was being killed by the butcher of Ballajora as Philip
      went by the shambles. The helpless creature, with its inverted head swung
      downwards from the block, looked at him with its piteous eyes, and gave
      forth that distressful cry which is the last wild appeal of the stricken
      animal when it sees death near, and has ceased to fight for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air was quiet, and the sea was calm, but across the Channel a leaden
      sky seemed to hover over the English mountains, though they were still
      light and apparently in sunshine. As Philip reached Port Mooar, a cart was
      coming out of it with a load of sea-wrack for the land, and a
      lobster-fisher on the beach was shipping his gear for sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quiet day,&rdquo; said Philip in passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not much liking the look of it, though,&rdquo; said the fisherman. &ldquo;Mortal
      thick surf coming up for the wind that's in.&rdquo; But he slipped his boat,
      pulled up sail, and rode away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip looked at his watch and then walked down the beach. Coming to a
      cave, he entered it. The sea-wrack was banked up in the darkness behind,
      and between two stones at the mouth there were the remains of a recent
      fire. Suddenly he remembered the cave. It was the cave of the Carasdhoo
      men. He éould hear the voice of Pete in its rumbling depths; he could hear
      and see himself. &ldquo;Shall we save the women, Pete?&mdash;we always do.&rdquo; &ldquo;Aw,
      yes, the women&mdash;and the boys.&rdquo; The tenderness of that memory was too
      much for Philip. He came out of the cave, and walked back over the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will come by the church,&rdquo; he thought, and he climbed the cliffs to
      look out. A line of fir-trees grew there, a comb of little misshapen
      ghoul-like things, stunted by the winds that swept over the seas in
      winter. In a fork of one of these a bird's nest of last year was still
      hanging; but it was now empty, songless, joyless, and dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's here.&rdquo; he told himself, and he drew his breath noisily. A white
      figure had turned the road by the sundial, and was coming on with the step
      of a greyhound.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black clouds above the English mountains were heeling down on the
      land. There was a storm on the other coast, though the sky over the island
      was still fine. The steamship had risen above the horizon, and was heading
      towards the bay.

    <h2>
      VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      She met him on the hill slope with a cry of joy, and kissed him. It came
      into his mind to draw away, but he could not, and he kissed her back. Then
      she linked her arm in his, and they turned down the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you've come,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever dream I wouldn't?&rdquo; she said. Her face was a smile, her voice
      was an eager whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have something to say to you, Kate&mdash;it is something serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it so?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So very serious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was laughing and blushing together. Didn't she know what he was going
      to say? Didn't she guess what this serious something must be? To prolong
      the delicious suspense before hearing it, she pretended to be absorbed in
      the things about her. She looked aside at the sea, and up at the banks,
      and down at the little dubbs of salt water as she skipped across them,
      crying out at sight of the sea-holly, the anemone, and the sea-mouse
      shining like fire, but still holding to Philip's arm and bounding and
      throbbing on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be quiet, dear, and listen,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'll be good&mdash;so very good,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But look! only look at
      the white horses out yonder&mdash;far out beyond the steamer. Davy's
      putting on the coppers for the parson, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught the grave expression of Philip's face, and drew herself up with
      pretended severity, saying, &ldquo;Be quiet, Katey. Behave yourself. Philip
      wants to talk to you&mdash;seriously&mdash;very seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, leaning forward with head aside to look up into his face, she said,
      &ldquo;Well, sir, why don't you begin? Perhaps you think I'll cry out. I won't&mdash;I
      promise you I won't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she grew uneasy at the settled gravity of his face, and the joy
      gradually died off her own. When Philip spoke, his voice was like a
      cracked echo of itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember what you said, Kate, when I brought you that last letter
      from Kimberley&mdash;that if next morning you found it was a mistake&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Is</i> it a mistake?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Becalm, Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite calm, dear. I remember I said it would kill me. But I was very
      foolish. I should not say so now. Is Pete alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke without a tremor, and he answered in a husky whisper, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, in a breaking voice, he said, &ldquo;We were very foolish Kate&mdash;jumping
      so hastily to a conclusion was very foolish-it was worse than foolish, it
      was wicked. I half doubted the letter at the time, but, God forgive me, I
      <i>wanted</i> to believe it, and so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad Pete is living,&rdquo; she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aghast at her calmness. The irregular lines in his face showed the
      disordered state of his soul, but she walked by his side without the
      quiver of an eyelid, or a tinge of colour more than usual. Had she
      understood?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he said, and he drew Pete's telegram from his pocket and gave it
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened it easily, and he watched her while she read it, prepared for a
      cry, and ready to put his arms about her if she fell. But there was not a
      movement save the motion of her fingers, not a sound except the crinking
      of the thin paper. He turned his head away. The sun was shining; there was
      a steely light on the firs, and here and there a white breaker was rising
      like a sea-bird out of the blue surface of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate, you astonish me,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;This comes on us like a
      thundercloud, and you seem not to realise it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her arms about his neck, and the paper rustled on his shoulder.
      &ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do you love me still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I love you, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is no thundercloud in heaven for me now,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simple grandeur of the girl's love shamed him. Its trust, its
      confidence, its indifference to all the evil chance of life if only he
      loved her still, this had been beyond him. But he disengaged her arms and
      said, &ldquo;We must not live in a fool's paradise, Kate. You promised yourself
      to Pete&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Philip,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that was when I was a child. It was only a half
      promise then, and I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't know what love
      was. All that came later, dearest, much later&mdash;you know when.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Pete it is the same thing, Kate,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;He is coming home to
      claim you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped him by getting in front of him and saying, with face down,
      smoothing his sleeve as she spoke, &ldquo;You are a man, Philip, and you cannot
      understand. How can you, and how can I tell you? When a girl is not a
      woman, but only a child, she is a different person. She can't love anybody
      then&mdash;not really&mdash;not to say love, and the promises she makes
      can't count. It was not I that promised myself to Pete&mdash;if I did
      promise. It was my little sister&mdash;the little sister that was me long,
      long ago, but is now gone&mdash;put to sleep inside me somewhere. Is that
      <i>very</i> foolish, darling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But think of Pete,&rdquo; said Philip; &ldquo;think of him going away for love of
      you, living five years abroad, toiling, slaving, saving, encountering
      privations, perhaps perils, and all for you, all for love of you. Then
      think of him coming home with his heart full of you, buoyed up with the
      hope of you, thirsting, starving, and yearning for you, and finding you
      lost to him, dead to him, worse than dead&mdash;it will kill him, Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was unmoved by the picture. &ldquo;I am very sorry, but I do not love him,&rdquo;
       she said quietly. &ldquo;I am sorry&mdash;what else can a girl be when she does
      not love a young man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He left me to take care of you, too, and you see&mdash;you see by the
      telegram&mdash;he is coming home with faith in my loyalty. How can I tell
      him that I have broken my trust? How can I meet him and explain&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Philip. Say we heard he was dead and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it would be too wretched. It's only three weeks since the letter came&mdash;and
      it would not be true, Kate&mdash;it would revolt me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her eyes in a fond look of shame-faced love, and said again, &ldquo;<i>I</i>
      know, then&mdash;lay the blame on me, Philip. What do I care? Say it was
      all my fault, and I made you love me. <i>I</i> shan't care for anybody's
      talk. And it's true, isn't it? Partly true, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I talked to Pete of temptation I should despise myself,&rdquo; said Philip;
      and then she threw her head up and said proudly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, tell the truth itself&mdash;the simple truth, Philip. Say we
      tried to be faithful and loyal, and all that, and could not, because we
      loved each other, and there was no help for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I tell him the truth, I shall die of shame,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;Oh, there
      is no way out of this miserable tangle. Whether I cover myself with
      deceit, or strip myself of evasion, I shall stain my soul for ever. I
      shall become a base man, and year by year sink lower and lower in the mire
      of lies and deceit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She listened with her eyes fixed on his quivering face, and her eyelids
      fluttered, and her fond looks began to be afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say that we married,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;we should never forget that you had
      broken your promise and I my trust. That memory would haunt us as long as
      we lived. We should never know one moment's happiness or one moment's
      peace. Pete would be a broken-hearted man, perhaps a wreck, perhaps&mdash;who
      knows?&mdash;dead of his own hand. He would be the ghost between us
      always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you think I should be afraid of that?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Indeed, no. If
      you were with me, Philip, and loved me still, I should not care for all
      the spirits of heaven itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face was as pale as death now, but her great eyes were shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our love would fail us, Kate,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;The sense of our guilt would
      kill it. How could we go on loving each other with a thing like that about
      us all day and all night&mdash;sitting at our table&mdash;listening to our
      talk&mdash;standing by our bed? Oh, merciful God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The terror of his vision mastered him, and he covered his face with both
      hands. She drew them down again and held them in a tight lock in her
      fingers. But the stony light of his eyes was more fearful to look upon,
      and she said in a troubled voice, &ldquo;Do you mean, Philip, that we&mdash;could&mdash;not
      marry&mdash;now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer, and she repeated the question, looking up into his face
      like a criminal waiting for his sentence&mdash;her head bent forward and
      her mouth open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We cannot,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;God help us, we dare not,&rdquo; he said; and then he
      tried to show her again how their marriage was impossible, now that Pete
      had come, without treason and shame and misery. But his words frayed off
      into silence. He caught the look of her eyes, and it was like the piteous
      look of the lamb under the hands of the butcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that what you came to tell me?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      His reply died in his throat. She divined rather than heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her doom had fallen on her, but she did not cry out. She did not yet
      realise in all its fulness what had happened. It was like a bullet-wound
      in battle; first a sense of air, almost of relief, then a pang, and then
      overwhelming agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been walking again, but she slid in front of him as she had done
      before. Her arms crept up his breast with a caressing touch, and linked
      themselves behind his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is only a jest, dearest,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;some test of my love, perhaps.
      You wished to make sure of me&mdash;quite, quite sure&mdash;now that Pete
      is alive and coming home. But, you see, I want only one to love me, only
      one, dear. Come, now, confess. Don't be afraid to say you have been
      playing with me. I shan't be angry with you. Come, speak to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not utter a word, and she let her arms fall from his neck; and
      they walked on side by side, both staring out to sea. The English
      mountains were black by this time. A tempest was raging on the other
      shore, though the air on this side was as soft as human breath. .
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she stopped, her feet scraped the gravel, and she exclaimed in a
      husky tone, &ldquo;I know what it is. It is not Pete. I am in your way. That's
      it. You can't get on with me about you. I am not fit for you. The distance
      between us is too great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He struggled to deny it, but he could not. It was part of the truth. He
      knew too well how near to being the whole truth it was. Pete had come at
      the last moment to cover up his conscience, but Kate was stripping it
      naked and showing him the skeleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all very well for you,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;but where am I? Why didn't you
      leave me alone? Why did you encourage me? Yes, indeed, encourage me!
      Didn't you say, though a woman couldn't raise herself in life, a man could
      lift her up if he only loved her? And didn't you tell me there was neither
      below nor above where there was true liking, and that if a woman belonged
      to some one, and some one belonged to her, it was God's sign that they
      were equal, and everything else was nothing&mdash;pride was nothing and
      position was nothing and the whole world was nothing? But now I know
      different. The world is between us. It always has been between us, and you
      can never belong to me. You will go on and rise up, and I will be left
      behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she broke into frightful laughter. &ldquo;Oh, I have been a fool! How I
      dreamt of being happy! I knew I was only a poor ignorant thing, but I saw
      myself lifted up by the one I loved. And now I am to be left alone. Oh, it
      is awful! Why did you deceive me? Yes, deceive me! Isn't that deceiving
      me? You deceived me when you led me to think that you loved me more than
      all the world. You don't I It is the world itself you love, and Pete is
      only your excuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she clutched at his arms, his hands, his breast, and at her
      own throat, as if something was strangling her. He did not answer her
      reproaches, for he knew well what they were. They were the bitter cry of
      her great love, her great misery, and her great jealousy of the world&mdash;the
      merciless and mysterious power that was luring him away. After awhile his
      silence touched her, and she came up to him, full of remorse, and said,
      &ldquo;No, no, Philip, you have nothing to reproach yourself with. You did not
      deceive me at all. I deceived myself. It was my own fault. I led you on&mdash;I
      know that. And yet I've been saying these cruel things. You'll forgive me,
      though, will you not? A girl can't help it sometimes, Philip. Are you
      crying? You are not crying, are you? Kiss me, Philip, and forgive me. You
      can do that, can't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She asked like a child, with her face up and her lips apart. He was about
      to yield, and was reaching forward to touch her forehead, when suddenly
      the child became the woman, and she leapt upon his breast, and held him
      fervently, her blood surging, her bosom exulting, her eyes flaming, and
      her passionate voice crying, &ldquo;Philip, you are mine. No, I will not release
      you. I don't care about your plans&mdash;you shall give them up. I don't
      care about your trust&mdash;you shall break it. I don't care about Pete
      coming&mdash;let him come. The world can do without you&mdash;I cannot.
      You are mine, Philip, and I am yours, and nobody else's, and never will
      be. You <i>must</i> come back to me, sooner or later, if you go away. I
      know it, I feel it, it's in my heart. But I'll never let you go. I can't,
      I can't. Haven't I a right to you? Yes, I have a right. Don't you
      remember?... Can you ever forget?... My <i>husband!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last word came muffled from his breast, where she had buried her head
      in the convulsions of her trembling at the moment when her modesty went
      down in the fierce battle with a higher pain. But the plea which seemed to
      give her the right to cling the closer made the man to draw apart. It was
      the old deep tragedy of human love&mdash;the ancient inequality in the
      bond of man and woman. What she had thought her conquest had been her
      vanquishment. He could not help, it&mdash;her last word had killed
      everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God,&rdquo; he groaned, &ldquo;that is the worst of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that neither can I marry you, nor can you marry Pete. You would
      carry to him your love of me, and bit by bit he would find it out, and it
      would kill him. It would kill you, too, for you have called me your
      husband, and you could never, never, never forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to marry Pete,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If I'm not to marry you, I don't
      want to marry any one. But do you mean that I must not marry at all&mdash;that
      I never can now that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word failed her, and his answer came thick and indistinct&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Philip? What about yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As there is no other man for you, Kate,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so there is no other
      woman for me. We must go through the world alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this my punishment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the punishment of both, Kate, the punishment of both alike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate stopped her breathing. Her clenched hands slackened away from his
      neck, and she stepped back from him, shuddering with remorse, and despair,
      and shame. She saw herself now for the first time a fallen woman. Never
      before had her sin touched her soul. It was at that moment she fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had come up to the cave by this time, and she sat on the stone at the
      mouth of it in a great outburst of weeping. It tore his heart to hear her.
      The voice of her weeping was like the distressful cry of the slaughtered
      lamb. He had to wrestle with himself not to take her in his arms and
      comfort her. The fit of tears spent itself at length, and after a time she
      drew a great breath and was quiet. Then she lifted her face, and the last
      gleam of the autumn sun smote her colourless lips and swollen eyes. When
      she spoke again, it was like one speaking in her sleep, or under the spell
      of somebody who had magnetised her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is wrong of me to think so much of myself, as if that were everything.
      I ought to feel sorry for you too. You must be driven to it, or you could
      never be so cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With his face to the sea, he mumbled something about Pete, and she caught
      up the name and said, &ldquo;Yes, and Pete too. As you think it would be wrong
      to Pete, I will not hold to you. Oh, it will be wrong to me as well! But I
      will not give you the pain of turning a deaf ear to my troubles any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was struggling with a pitiless hope that perhaps she might regain him
      after all. &ldquo;If I give him up,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;he will love me for it;&rdquo; and
      then, with a sad ring in her voice, she said, &ldquo;You will go on and be a
      great man now, for you'll not have me to hold you back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For pity's sake, say no more of that,&rdquo; he said, but she paid no heed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to think it a wonderful thing to be loved by a great man. I don't
      now. It is terrible. If I could only have you to myself! If you could only
      be nothing to anybody else! You would be everything to me, and what should
      I care then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Between torture and love he had almost broken down at that, but he gripped
      his breast and turned half aside, for his eyes were streaming. She came up
      to him and touched with the tips of her fingers the hand that hung by his
      side, and said in a voice like a child's, &ldquo;Fancy! this is the end of
      everything, and when we part now we are to meet no more. Not the same way
      at all&mdash;not as we have met. You will be like anybody else to me, and
      I will be like anybody else to you. Miss Cregeen, that will be my name and
      you will be Mr. Christian. When you see me you'll say to yourself, 'Yes,
      poor thing; long ago, when she was a girl, I made her love me. Nobody ever
      loved me like that.' And fancy! when you pass me in the street, you will
      not even look my way. You won't, will you? No&mdash;no, it will be better
      not. Goodbye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her simple tenderness almost stifled him. He had to hold his under lip
      with his teeth to keep back the cry that was bursting from his tongue. At
      last he could bear it no longer, and he broke out, &ldquo;Would to God we had
      never loved each other! Would to God we had never met!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she answered with the same childish sweetness, &ldquo;Don't say that,
      Philip. We have had some happy hours together. I would rather be parted
      from you like this, though it is so hard, so cruel, than never to have met
      you at all. Isn't it something for me to think of, that the truest,
      cleverest, noblest man in all the world has loved me?... Good-bye!...
      Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His heart bled, his heart cried, but he uttered no sound. They were side
      by side. She let his hand slip from the tips of her fingers, and drew
      silently away. At three paces apart she paused, but he gave no sign. She
      climbed the low brow of the hill slowly, very slowly, trying to command
      her throat, which was fluttering, and looking back through her tears as
      she went. Philip heard the shingle slip under her feet while she toiled up
      the cliff, and when she reached the top the soft thud on the turf seemed
      to beat on his heart. She stood there a moment against the sky, waiting
      for a sound from the shore, a cry, a word, the lifting of a hand, a sob, a
      sigh, her own name, &ldquo;Kate,&rdquo; and she was ready to fly back even then,
      wounded and humiliated as she was, a poor torn bird that had been
      struggling in the lime. But no; he was silent and motionless, and she
      disappeared behind the hill. He saw her go, and all the light of heaven
      went with her.

      VIII.

    <p>
      It was so far back home, so much farther than it had been to come. The
      course is short and easy going out to sea when the tide is with you, and
      the water is smooth, and the sun is shining, but long and hard coming back
      to harbour, when the waves have risen, and the sky is low, and the wind is
      on your bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, so very far. She thought everybody looked at her, and knew her for
      what she was&mdash;a broken, forsaken, fallen woman. And she was so tired
      too; she wondered if her limbs would carry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Philip was left alone, the sky seemed to be lying on his shoulders.
      The English mountains were grey and ghostly now, and the storm, which had
      spent itself on the other coast, seemed to hang over the island. There
      were breakers where the long dead sea had been, and the petrel outside was
      scudding close to the white curves, and uttering its dismal note.
    </p>
    <p>
      So heavy and confused had the storm and wreck of the last hour left him,
      that he did not at first observe by the backward tail of smoke that the
      steamer had passed round the Head, and that the cart he had met at the
      mouth of the port had come back empty to the cave for another load of
      sea-wrack. The lobster-fisher, too, had beached his boat near by, and was
      shouting through the hollow air, wherein every noise seemed to echo with a
      sepulchral quake, &ldquo;The block was going whistling at the mast-head. We'll
      have a squall I was thinking, so in I came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night Philip dreamt a dream. He was sitting on a dais with a wooden
      canopy above him, the English coat of arms behind, and a great book in
      front; his hands shook as he turned the leaves; he felt his leg hang
      heavily; people bowed low to him, and dropped their voices in his
      presence; he was the Deemster, and he was old. A young woman stood in the
      dock, dripping water from her hair, and she had covered her face with her
      hands. In the witness-box a young man was standing, and his head was down.
      The man had delivered the woman to dishonour; she had attempted her life
      in her shame and her despair. And looking on the man, the Deemster thought
      he spoke in a stern voice, saying, &ldquo;Witness, I am compelled to punish her,
      but oh to heaven that I could punish you in her place! What have you to
      say for yourself?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have nothing to say for myself,&rdquo; the young man
      answered, and he lifted his head and the old Deemster saw his face. Then
      Philip awoke with a smothered scream, for the young man's face had been
      his own.

    <h2>
      IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Cæsar got to the quay, he looked about with watchful eyes, as if
      fearing he might find somebody there before him. The coast was clear, and
      he gave a grunt of relief. After fixing the horse-cloth, and settling the
      mare in a nose-bag, he began to walk up and down the fore part of the
      harbour, still keeping an eager look-out. As time went on he grew
      comfortable, exchanged salutations with the harbour-master, and even
      whistled a little to while away the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quiet day, Mr. Quayle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quiet enough yet, Mr. Cregeen; but what's it saying? 'The greater the
      calm the nearer the south wind.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the time that Cæsar, from the end of the pier, saw the smoke of the
      steamer coming round Kirk Maughold Head, he was in a spiritual, almost a
      mournful, mood. He was feeling how melancholy was the task of going to
      meet the few possessions, the clothes and such like, which were all that
      remained of a dear friend departed. It was the duty of somebody, though,
      and Cæsar drew a long breath of resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steamer came up to the quay, and there was much bustle and confusion.
      Cæsar waited, with one hand on the mare's neck, until the worst of it was
      over. Then he went aboard, and said in a solemn voice to the sailor at the
      foot of the gangway, &ldquo;Anything here the property of Mr. Peter Quilliam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's his luggage,&rdquo; said the sailor, pointing to a leather trunk of
      moderate size among similar trunks at the mouth of the hatchway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm!&rdquo; said Cæsar, eyeing it sideways, and thinking how small it was.
      Then, reflecting that perhaps valuable papers were all it was thought
      worth while to send home, he added cheerfully, &ldquo;I'll take it with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat to Cæsar's surprise, the sailor raised no difficulties, but just
      as he was regarding the trunk with that faith which is the substance of
      things hoped for, a big, ugly hand laid hold of it, and began to rock it
      about like a pebble.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Black Tom, smoking with perspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aisy, man, aisy,&rdquo; said Cæsar, with lofty dignity. &ldquo;I've the gig on the
      quay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I've a stiff cart on the market,&rdquo; said Black Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm wanting no assistance,&rdquo; said Cæsar; &ldquo;you needn't trouble yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't mention it, Cæsar,&rdquo; said Black Tom, and he turned the trunk on end
      and bent his back to lift it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cæsar put a heavy hand on top and said, &ldquo;Gough bless me, man, but I am
      sorry for thee. Mammon hath entered into thy heart, Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He have just popped out of thine, then,&rdquo; said Black Tom, swirling the
      trunk on one of its corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cæsar held on, and said, &ldquo;I don't know in the world why you should let
      the devil of covetousness get the better of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mane to&mdash;let go the chiss,&rdquo; said Black Tom, and in another
      minute he had it on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I believe in my heart,&rdquo; said Cæsar, &ldquo;I would be forgiven a little
      violence,&rdquo; and he took the trunk by both hands to bring it down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go the chiss, or I'll strek thee into the harbour,&rdquo; bawled Black Tom
      under his load.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Philistines be upon thee, Samson,&rdquo; cried Cæsar, and with that there
      was a struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the uproar, while the men were shouting into each other's
      faces, and the trunk was rocking between them shoulder high, a sunburnt
      man, with a thick beard and a formidable voice, a stalwart fellow in a
      pilot jacket and wide-brimmed hat, came hurrying up the cabin-stairs, and
      a dog came running behind him. A moment later he had parted the two men,
      and the trunk was lying at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Tom fell back a step, lifted his straw hat, scratched his bald
      crown, and muttered in a voice of awe. &ldquo;Holy sailor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar's face was livid, and his eyes went up toward his forehead. &ldquo;Lord
      have mercy upon me,&rdquo; he mumbled; &ldquo;have mercy on my soul, O Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be afraid,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;I'm a living man and not a ghost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man himself,&rdquo; said Black Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter Quilliam alive and hearty,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;And now, what's the bobbery between the pair of you?
      Shuperintending the beaching of my trunk, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But having recovered from his terror at the idea that Pete was a spirit,
      Cæsar began to take him to task for being a living man. &ldquo;How's this?&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;Answer me, young man, I've praiched your funeral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to do it again, Mr. Cregeen, for I'm not gone yet,&rdquo; said
      Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but worth ten dead men still,&rdquo; said Black Tom. &ldquo;And my goodness, boy,
      the smart and stout you're looking, anyway. Been thatching a bit on the
      chin, eh? Foreign parts has made a man of you, Peter. The straight you're
      like the family, too! You'll be coming up to the trough with me&mdash;the
      ould home, you know. I'll be whipping the chiss ashore in a jiffy, only
      Cæsar's that eager to help, it's wonderful. No, you'll not then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete was shaking his head as he went up the gangway, and seeing this,
      Cæsar said severely&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lave the gentleman alone, Mr. Quilliam. He knows his own business best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do you, Mr. Collecting Box,&rdquo; said Black Tom. &ldquo;But your head's as empty
      as a mollag, and as full of wind as well. It's a regular ould human mollag
      you are, anyway, floating other people's nets and taking all that's coming
      to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were ashore by this time; one of the quay porters was putting the
      trunk into the gig, and Cæsar was removing the horse-cloth and the
      nose-bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up, Mr. Peter, and don't listen to him,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;If my industry
      and integrity have been blessed with increase under Providence&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lave Providence out of it, you grasping ould Ebenezer, Zachariah, Amen,&rdquo;
       bawled Black Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been flying in the face of Providence all your life, Tom,&rdquo; said
      Cæsar, taking his seat beside Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't though, you miser,&rdquo; said Black Tom; &ldquo;you'd sell your soul for
      sixpence, and you'd raffle your ugly ould body if you could get anybody to
      take tickets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go home, Thomas,&rdquo; said Cæsar, twiddling the reins, &ldquo;go home and try for
      the future to be a better man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But that was too much for Black Tom. &ldquo;Better man, is it? Come down on the
      quay and up with your fiss, and I'll show you which of us is the better
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later Cæsar and Pete were rattling over the cobbles of the
      market-place, with the dog racing behind. Pete was full of questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how's yourself, Mr. Cregeen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm in, sir, I'm in, sir, praise the Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Grannie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like myself, sir, not getting a dale younger, but caring little for
      spiritual things, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going west, is she, poor ould angel? There ought to be a good piece of
      daylight at her yet, for all. And&mdash;and Nancy Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A happy sinner still,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;I suppose, sir, you'd be making good
      money out yonder now? We were hearing the like, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money!&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Well, yes. Enough to keep off the divil and the
      coroner. But how's&mdash;how's&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now! For life, eh?&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for life; but that's nothing,&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;how's&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; cried Cæsar; &ldquo;five years too! Boy veen, the light was nearly
      took out of my eyes when I saw you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Kate? How's Kate? How's the girl, herself?&rdquo; said Pete nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smart uncommon,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless her!&rdquo; cried Pete, with a shout that was heard across the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll pick her up at Crellin's, it's like,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Crellin's round the corner&mdash;Crellin the draper's I Woa! Let me
      down! The mare's tired, father;&rdquo; and Pete was over the wheel at a bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came out of the shop saying Kate had left word that her father was not
      to wait for her&mdash;she would perhaps be home before him. Amid a crowd
      of the &ldquo;mob beg&rdquo; children of the streets, to whom he showered coppers to
      be scrambled for, Pete got up again to Cæsar's side, and they set off for
      Sulby. The wind had risen suddenly, and was hooting down the narrow
      streets coming up from the harbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Philip? How's Philip?&rdquo; shouted Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Christian? Well and hearty, and doing wonders, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; cried Pete, with a resounding laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going like a flood, and sweeping everything before him,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rising day with him, is it?&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;I always said he'd be the
      first man in the island, and he's not going to deceave me neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young man's been over putting a sight on us times and times&mdash;he
      was up at my Melliah only a week come Wednesday,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man alive!&rdquo; cried Pete; &ldquo;him and me are same as brothers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it wasn't true what they were writing in the letter, sir&mdash;that
      your black boys left you for dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did that, bad luck to them,&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;but I was thinking it no
      sin to disappoint them, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! lying began with the world, and with the world it will end,&rdquo;
       said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they passed Ballywhaine, Pete shouted into Cæsar's ear, above the wind
      that was roaring in the trees, and scattering the ripening leaves in
      clouds, &ldquo;And how's Dross?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wastrel? Aw, tearing away, tearing away,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Floating on the top of the tide, is he?&rdquo; shouted Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe so, but the devil is fishing where yonder fellow's swimming,&rdquo;
       answered Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the ould man&mdash;the Ballawhaine&mdash;still above the sod?&rdquo; bawled
      Pete behind his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but failing, failing, failing,&rdquo; shouted Cæsar. &ldquo;The world's getting
      too heavy for the man. Debts here, and debts there, and debts everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much water in the harbour then, eh?&rdquo; cried Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but down on the rocks already, if it's only myself that knows it,&rdquo;
       shouted Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had turned the Sulby Bridge, and come in sight of &ldquo;The Manx
      Fairy,&rdquo; Pete's excitement grew wild, and he leaped up from his seat and
      shouted above the wind like a man possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gough, the very place! You've been thatching, though&mdash;yes, you
      have. The street! Holy sailor, there it is! Brownie at you still? Her
      heifer, is it? Get up, Molly! A taste of the whip'll do the mare no harm,
      sir. My sakes, here's ould Flora hobbling out to meet us. Got the
      rheumatics, has she? Set me down, Cæsar. Here we are, man. Lord alive, the
      smell of the cowhouse. That warm and damp, it's grand! What, don't you
      know me, Flo? Got your temper still, if you've lost your teeth? My sakes,
      the haggard! The same spot again! It's turf they're burning inside! And,
      my gracious, that's herrings roasting in their brine! Where's Grannie,
      though? Let's put a sight in, Cæsar. Well, well, aw well, aw well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus Pete came home, laughing, shouting, bawling, and bellowing above the
      tumult of the wind, which had risen by this time to the strength of a
      gale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; cried Cæsar, going in at the porch, &ldquo;gentleman here from foreign
      parts to put a word on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never had nobody there belonging to me,&rdquo; began Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, then, nobody?&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One that was going to be, maybe, if he'd lived, poor boy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grannie!&rdquo; shouted Pete, and he burst into the bar-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness me!&rdquo; cried Grannie; &ldquo;it's his own voice anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's himself,&rdquo; shouted Pete, and the old soul was in his arms in an
      instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw dear! Aw dear!&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;Pete it is for sure. Let me sit down,
      though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you think it was his ghost, then, mother!&rdquo; said Cæsar with an
      indulgent air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Deed no,&rdquo; said Grannie. &ldquo;The lad wouldn't come back to plague nobody,
      thinks I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, and for all the uprisement of Peter, it bates everything,&rdquo; said
      Cæsar. &ldquo;It's a sort of a resurrection. I thought I'd have a sight up to
      the packet for his chiss, poor fellow, and, behould ye, who should I meet
      in the two eyes but the man himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, dear! It's wonderful I it's terrible! I'm silly with the joy,&rdquo; said
      Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was lies in the letter the Manx ones were writing,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letters and writings are all lies,&rdquo; said Grannie. &ldquo;As long as I live I'll
      take no more of them, and if that Kelly, the postman, comes here again,
      I'll take the bellows to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you thought I was gone for good, Grannie?&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Well, I thought
      so too. 'Will I die?' I says to myself times and times; but I bethought me
      at last there wasn't no sense in a good man like me laving his bones out
      on the bare Veldt yonder; so, you see, I spread my wings and came home
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the Lord's doings&mdash;it's marvellous in our eyes,&rdquo; said Cæsar;
      and Grannie, who had recovered herself and was bustling about, cried&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me have a right look at him, then. Goodness me, the whisker! And as
      soft as Manx carding from the mill, too. I like him best when he takes off
      his hat. Well, I'm proud to see you, boy. 'Deed, but I wouldn't have known
      you, though. 'Who's the gentleman in the gig with father?' thinks I. And
      I'd have said it was the Dempster himself, if he hadn't been dead and in
      his coffin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll do, that'll do,&rdquo; roared Pete. &ldquo;That's Grannie putting the fun on
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no use talking, but I can't keep quiet; no I can't,&rdquo; cried Grannie,
      and with that she whipped up a bowl from the kitchen dresser and fell
      furiously to peeling the potatoes that were there for supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where's Kate?&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, yes, where is she? Kate! Kate!&rdquo; called Grannie, leaning her head
      toward the stairs, and Nancy Joe, who had been standing silent until now,
      said&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't she go to Ramsey with the gig, woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, the foolish I am! Of course she did,&rdquo; said Grannie; &ldquo;but why hasn't
      she come back with father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She left word at Crellin's not to wait,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll be gone to Miss Clucas's to try on,&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't trust now,&rdquo; said Grannie. &ldquo;She's having two new dresses done,
      Pete. Aw, girls are ter'ble. Well, can you blame them either?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shall have two-and-twenty if she likes, God bless her,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness me!&rdquo; said Nancy, &ldquo;is the man for buying frocks for a Mormon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you'll be empty, boy. Put the crow down and the griddle on, Nancy,&rdquo;
       said Grannie. &ldquo;We'll have cakes. Cakes? Coorse I said cakes. Get me the
      cloth and I'll lay it myself. The cloth, I'm saying, woman. Did you never
      hear of a tablecloth? Where is it? Aw, dear knows where it is now! It's in
      the parlour; no, it's in the chest on the landing; no, it's under the
      sheets of my own bed. Fetch it, bogh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will I bring you a handful of gorse, mother?&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coorse you will, and not stand chattering there. But I'm laving you dry,
      Pete. Is it ale you'll have, or a drop of hard stuff? You'll wait for
      Kate? Now I like that. There's some life at these totallers. 'Steady
      abroad?' How dare you, Nancy Joe? You're a deal too clever. Of course he's
      been steady abroad&mdash;steady as a gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Kate,&rdquo; said Pete, tramping the sanded floor, &ldquo;is she changed at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, she's a woman now, boy,&rdquo; said Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was looking a bit white and narvous one while there, but she's sprung
      out of it fresh and bright, same as the ling on the mountains. Well,
      that's the way with young women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Just the break of the morning with the darlings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she's the best-looking girl on the island now, Pete,&rdquo; said Nancy Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go bail on it,&rdquo; cried Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big and fine and rosy, and fit for anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have seen her at the Melliah; it was a trate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sun-bonnet and pink frock and tight red stockings, and straight as a
      standard rase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hould your tongue, woman,&rdquo; shouted Pete. &ldquo;I'll see herself first, and I'm
      dying to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar came back with the gorse; Nancy fed the fire and Grannie stirred the
      oatmeal and water. And while the cakes were baking, Pete tramped the
      kitchen and examined everything and recognised old friends with a roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me! the same place still. There's the clock on the shelf, with the
      scratch on its face and the big finger broke at the joint, and the lath&mdash;and
      the peck&mdash;and the whip&mdash;you've had it new corded, though&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Sakes, how the boy remembers!&rdquo; cried Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the white rumpy&rdquo; (the cat had leapt on to the dresser out of the
      reach of Pete's dog, and from that elevation was eyeing him steadfastly),
      &ldquo;and the slowrie&mdash;and the kettle&mdash;and the poker&mdash;my
      gracious, the very poker&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, did you ever!&rdquo; cried Grannie with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;yes&mdash;no&mdash;it is, though&mdash;I'll swear it before the
      Dempster&mdash;that's,&rdquo; said Pete, picking up a three-legged stool,
      &ldquo;that's the very stool she was sitting on herself in the fire-seat in
      front of the turf closet. Let me sit there now for the sake of ould times
      gone by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put the stool in the fireplace and sat on it, shouting as he did so
      between a laugh and a cry, &ldquo;Aw, Grannie, bogh&mdash;Grannie, bogh! to
      think there's been half the world between us since I was sitting here
      before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Grannie herself, breaking down, said, &ldquo;Wouldn't you like the tongs,
      boy? Give the boy the tongs, woman, just to say he's at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete plucked the tongs out of Nancy's hands, and began feeding the fire
      with the gorse. &ldquo;Aw, Grannie, have I ever been away?&rdquo; he cried, laughing,
      and his wet eyes gleaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy Joe, have you no nose at all?&rdquo; cried Grannie. &ldquo;The cake's burning
      to a cinder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it burn, mother,&rdquo; shouted Pete. &ldquo;It's the way she was doing herself
      when she was young and forgetting. Shillings a-piece for all that's
      wasted. Aw, the smell of it's sweet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying he piled the gorse on the fire, ramming it under the griddle and
      choking it behind the crow. And while the oatcake crackled and sparched
      and went black, he sniffed up the burning odour, and laughed and cried in
      the midst of the smoke that went swirling up the chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
      And meanwhile, Grannie herself, with the tears rolling down her cheeks,
      was flapping her apron before her face and saying, &ldquo;He'll make me die of
      laughing, he will, though&mdash;yes, he will!&rdquo; But behind the apron she
      was blubbering to Nancy, &ldquo;It's coming home, woman, that's it&mdash;it's
      just coming home again, poor boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time word of Pete's return had gone round Sulby? and the bar-room
      was soon thronged with men and women, who looked through the glass
      partition into the kitchen at the bronzed and bearded man who sat smoking
      by the fire, with his dog curled up at his feet. &ldquo;There'll be a wedding
      soon,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;The girl's in luck,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;Success to the fine
      girl she always was, and lucky they kept her from the poor toot that was
      beating about on her port bow.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The young Ballawhaine, eh?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Who
      else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently the dog went out to them, and, in default of its master, became
      a centre of excited interest. It was an old creature, with a settled look
      of age, and a gravity of expression that seemed to say he had got over the
      follies of youth, and was now reserved and determined to keep the peace.
      His back was curved in as if a cart-wheel had gone over his spine, he had
      gigantic ears, a stump of a tail, a coat thin and prickly like the
      bristles of a pig, but white and spotted with brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord save us! a queer dog, though&mdash;what's his breed at all?&rdquo; said
      one; and then a resounding voice came from the kitchen doorway, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sort of a Manxman crossed with a bat. Got no tail to speak of, but
      there's plenty of ears at him. A handy sort of a dog, only a bit spoiled
      in his childhood. Not fit for much company anyway, and no more notion of
      dacent behaviour than my ould shoe. Down, Dempster, down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Pete. He was greeted with loud welcomes, and soon filled the room
      all round with the steaming odour of spirits and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've the Manx tongue at you still, Mr. Quilliam,&rdquo; said Jonaique; &ldquo;and
      you're calling the dog Dempster; what's that for at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For sake of the ould island, Mr. Jelly, and for the straight he's like
      Dempster Mylrea when he's a bit crooked,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old man's dead, sir,&rdquo; said John the Clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say?&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, though; the sun went down on him a Wednesday. The drink, sir, the
      drink! I've been cutting a sod of his grave to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who's to be Dempster now?&rdquo; asked Pete. &ldquo;Who are they putting in for
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said John the Clerk, &ldquo;they're talking and talking, and some's
      saying this one and others that one; but the most is saying your ould
      friend Philip Christian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it&mdash;I always said it,&rdquo; shouted Pete; &ldquo;best man in the island,
      bar none. Oh, he'll not deceave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wind was roaring in the chimney, and the light was beginning to fail.
      Pete became restless, and walked to and fro, peering out at intervals by
      the window that looked on to the road. At this there was some pushing and
      nudging and indulgent whispering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the girl! Aw, be aisy with the like! Five years apart, be aisy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The meadow's white with the gulls sitting together like parrots; what's
      that a sign of, father?&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a slant of rain maybe, and a puff of wind,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Pete, looking up at the sky, &ldquo;the long cat tail was going off
      at a slant awhile ago, and now the thick skate yonder is hanging mortal
      low.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your time, sir,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;No need to send round the Cross Vustha
      (fiery cross) yet. The girl will be home immadiently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'll be dark at her, though,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company tried to draw him into conversation about the ways of life in
      the countries he had visited, but he answered absently and jerkily, and
      kept going to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose there'll be Dempsters enough where you're coming from?&rdquo; said
      Jonaique.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sort of Dempsters, yes. Called one of them Ould Necessity, because it
      knows no law. He rigged up the statute books atop of his stool for a high
      sate, and when he wanted them he couldn't find them high or low. Not the
      first judge that's sat on the law, though.... It's coming, Cæsar, d'ye
      hear it? That's the rain on the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aisy, man, aisy, man,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;New dresses isn't rigged up in no
      time. There'll be chapels now, eh? Chapels and conferences, and proper
      religious instruction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil a chapel, sir, only a rickety barn, belonging to some-ones they're
      calling the Sky Pilots to. Wanted the ould miser that runs it to build
      them a new tabernacle, but he wouldn't part till a lump of plaster fell on
      his bald head at a love-feast, and then he planked down a hundred pound,
      and they all shouted, 'Hit him again, Lord&mdash;you might!'... D'ye hear
      that, then? That's the water coming down from the gill. I can't stand no
      more of it, Grannie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grannie was at the door, struggling to hold it against the wind, while she
      looked out into the gathering darkness. &ldquo;'Deed, but I'm getting afraid of
      it myself,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and dear heart knows where Kirry can be at this
      time of night.&rdquo; &ldquo;I'm off to find her,&rdquo; said Pete, and, catching up his hat
      and whistling to the dog, in a moment he was gone.
    </p>

    <p>
      The door was hard to close behind him, for it was now blowing a gale from
      the north-east. Cæsar slipped through the dairy to see if the outbuildings
      were safe, and came back with a satisfied look. The stable and cow-house
      were barred, the barns were shut up, the mill-wheel was on the brake, the
      kiln fire was burning gently, and all was snug and tight. Grannie was
      wringing her hands as he returned, crying &ldquo;Kate! Oh, Kate!&rdquo; and he
      reproved her for want of trust in Providence.
    </p>
    <p>
      People were now coming in rapidly with terrible stories of damage done by
      the storm. It was reported that the Chicken Rock Lighthouse was blown
      down, that the tide had risen to twenty-five feet in Ramsey and torn up
      the streets, and that a Peel fisherman had been struck by his mainsail
      into the sea and drowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      More came into the house at every minute, and among them were all the
      lonesome and helpless ones within a radius of a mile&mdash;Blind Jane, who
      charmed blood, but could not charm the wind; Shemiah, the prophet, with
      beard down to his waist and a staff up to his shoulder; and old Juan
      Vessy, who &ldquo;lived on the houses&rdquo; in the way of a tramp. The people who had
      been there already were afraid to go out, and Grannie, still wringing her
      hands and crying &ldquo;Kate, Kate,&rdquo; called everybody into the kitchen to gather
      about the fire. There they bemoaned their boys on the sea, told stories of
      former storms, and quarrelled about the years of wrecks and the sources of
      the winds that caused them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gale increased to fearful violence, and sometimes the wind sounded
      like sheets flapping against the walls, sometimes like the deep boom of
      the waves that roll on themselves in mid-ocean and never know a shore. It
      began to groan in the chimney as if it were a wild beast struggling to
      escape, and then the smoke came down in whorls and filled the kitchen.
      They had to put out the fire to keep themselves from suffocation, and to
      sit back from the fireplace to protect themselves from cold. The door of
      the porch flew open, and they barricaded it with long-handled brushes; the
      windows rattled in their frames, and they blocked them up with the tops of
      the tables. In spite of all efforts to shut out the wind, the house was
      like a basket, and it quaked like a ship at sea. &ldquo;I never heard the like
      on the water itself, and I'm used of the sea, too,&rdquo; said one. The others
      groaned and mumbled prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kelly the Thief, who had come in unopposed by Grannie, was on his knees in
      one corner with his face to the wall, calling on the Lord to remember that
      he had seen things in letters&mdash;stamps and such&mdash;but had never
      touched them. John the Clerk was saying that he had to bury the Deemster;
      Jonaique, the barber, that he had been sent for to &ldquo;cut&rdquo; the Bishop; and
      Claudius Kewley, the farmer, that he had three fields of barley still
      uncut and a stack of oats unthatched. &ldquo;Oh, Lord,&rdquo; cried Claudius, &ldquo;let me
      not die till I've got nothing to do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar stood like a strong man amidst their moans and groans, their bowings
      of the head and clappings of the hands, and, when he heard the farmer, his
      look was severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cloddy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how do you dare to doubt the providence of God?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aisy to talk, Mr. Cregeen,&rdquo; the farmer whined, &ldquo;but you've got your own
      harvest saved,&rdquo; and then Cæsar had no resource but to punish the man in
      prayer. &ldquo;The Lord had sent His storm to reprove some that were making too
      sure of His mercies; but there was grace in the gale, only they wouldn't
      be patient and trust to God's providence; there was milk in the breast,
      only the wayward child wouldn't take time to find the teat. Lord, lead
      them to true stillness&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of Cæsar's prayer there was a sudden roar outside, and he
      leapt abruptly to his feet with a look of vexation. &ldquo;I believe in my heart
      that's the mill-wheel broken loose,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and if it is, the corn on
      the kiln will be going like a whirlingig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust in God's providence, Cæsar,&rdquo; cried the farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I will,&rdquo; said Cæsar, catching up his hat, &ldquo;but I'll put out my kiln
      fire first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Pete stepped out of the porch, he felt himself smitten as by an
      invisible wing, and he gasped like a fish with too much air. A quick pain
      in the side at that moment reminded him of his bullet-wound, but his heels
      had heart in them, and he set off to run. The night had fallen, but a
      green rent was torn in the leaden sky, and through this the full moon
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he got to Ramsey the tide was up to the old cross, slates were flying
      like kites, and the harbour sounded like a battlefield with its thunderous
      roar of rigging. He made for the dressmaker's, and heard that Kate had not
      been there for six hours. At the draper's he learned that at two o'clock
      in the afternoon she had been seen going up Ballure. The sound rocket was
      fired as he pushed through the town. A schooner riding to an anchor in the
      bay was flying her ensign for help. The sea was terrific&mdash;a slaty
      grey, streaked with white foam like quartz veins; but the men who had been
      idling on the quay when the water was calm were now struggling, chafing,
      and fighting to go out on it, for the blood of the old Vikings was in
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going by the water-trough, Pete called on Black Tom, who was civil and
      conciliatory until he heard his errand, then growled with disappointment,
      but nevertheless answered his question. Yes, he had seen the young woman.
      She went up early in the &ldquo;everin,&rdquo; and left him good-day. Giving this
      grateful news, Black Tom could not deny himself a word of bitterness to
      poison the pleasure. &ldquo;And when you are finding her,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you'll be
      doing well to take her in tow, for I'm thinking there's some that's for
      throwing her a rope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who d'ye mane?&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lave it with you,&rdquo; said Black Tom; and Pete pulled the door after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the breast of the hill there was the meeting of two roads, one of them
      leading up to the &ldquo;Hibernian,&rdquo; the other going down to Port Mooar. To
      resolve the difficulty of choice, Pete inquired at a cottage standing some
      paces beyond, and as Kate had not been seen to pass up the higher road, he
      determined to take the lower one. But he gathered no tidings by the way,
      for Billy by the mill knew nothing, and the woman by the sundial had gone
      to bed. At length he dipped into Port Mooar, and came to a little cottage
      like a child's Noah's ark, with its tiny porch and red light inside,
      looking out on the white breakers that were racing along the beach. It was
      the cottage of the lobster-fisher. Pete inquired if he had seen Kate. He
      answered no; he had seen nobody that day but Mr. Christian. Which of the
      Christians? Mr. Philip Christian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news carried only one message to Pete's mind. It seemed to explain
      something which had begun to perplex him&mdash;why Philip had not met him
      at the quay, and why Kate had not heard of his coming. Clearly Philip was
      at present at Ballure. He had not yet received the telegram addressed to
      Douglas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete turned back. Surely Kate had called somewhere. She would be at home
      by this time. He tried to run, but the wind was now in his face. It was
      veering northwards every minute, and rising to the force of a hurricane.
      He tied his handkerchief over his head and under his chin to hold on his
      hat. His hair whipped his ears like rods. Sometimes he was swept into the
      hedge; often he was brought to his knees. Still he toiled along through
      sheets of spray that glistened with the colours of a rainbow, and ran over
      the ground like driven rain. His eyes smarted, and the taste on his lips
      was salt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon was now riding at the full through a wild flecked sky, and Pete
      could clearly see, as he returned towards the bay, a crowd of human
      figures on the cliffs above Port Lewaige. Quaking with undefined fears, he
      pushed on until he had joined them. The schooner, abandoned by her crew,
      had parted her cable, and was rolling like a blinded porpoise towards the
      rocks. She fell on them with the groan of a living creature, and, the
      instant her head was down, the white lions of the sea leapt over her with
      a howl, the water swirled through her bulwarks and filled her hatches, her
      rudder was unshipped, her sails were torn from their gaskets, and the
      floating home wherein men had sailed, and sung, and slept, and laughed,
      and jested, was a broken wreck in the heavy wallowings of the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate had not returned when Pete got back to Sulby, but the excitement of
      her absence was eclipsed for the time by the turmoil of Cæsar's trouble.
      Standing in the dark on the top of the midden, he was shouting to the
      dairy door in a voice of thunder, which went off at the end of his beard
      like the puling of a cat. The mill-wheel was going same as a &ldquo;whirlingig&rdquo;&mdash;was
      there nobody to &ldquo;hould the brake?&rdquo; The stable roof was stripped, and the
      mare was tearing herself to pieces in a roaring &ldquo;pit of hell&rdquo;&mdash;was
      there never a shoulder for the door? The cow-house thatch was flapping
      like a sail&mdash;was there nothing in the world but a woman (Nancy Joe)
      to help a man to throw a ladder and a stone over it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Only when Cæsar had been pacified was there silence to speak of Kate. &ldquo;I
      picked up news of her coming back by Claughbane,&rdquo; said Pete, &ldquo;and traced
      her as near home as the 'Ginger.' She can't be far away. Where is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those who were cool enough fell to conjecture. Grannie had no resource but
      groans. Nancy was moaning by her side. The rest were full of their own
      troubles. Blind Jane was bewailing her affliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can all see,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;but I'm not knowing the harm that's coming
      on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, woman, hush,&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;we're all same as yourself half our lives&mdash;we're
      all blind at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the tumult a knock came to the door, and Pete made a
      plunge towards the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; cried Cæsar. &ldquo;Nobody else comes here to-night except the girl
      herself. Another wind like the last and we'll have the roof off the house
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he called to the new-comer, with his face to the porch door, and the
      answer came back to him in a wail like the wind itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Joney from the glen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're like herrings in a barrel&mdash;we can't let you in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wasn't wanting to come in. But her roof was going stripping, and half
      her house was felled, and she couldn't get her son (the idiot boy) to
      leave his bed. He would perish; he would die; he was all the family she
      had left to her&mdash;wouldn't the master come and save him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; shouted Cæsar. &ldquo;We've our own missing this fearful night,
      Joney, and the Lord will protect His children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was it Kate? She had seen her in the glen&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me get at that door,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the house will come down,&rdquo; cried Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it come,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete shut the door of the bar-room, and then the wind was heard to swirl
      through the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you see her, Joney, and where?&rdquo; said the voice of Pete; and the
      voice of Joney answered him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goings by my own house at the start of the storm this everin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll come with you&mdash;go on,&rdquo; said Pete, and Grannie shouted across
      the bar&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take Cæsar's topcoat over your monkey-jacket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've sail enough already for a wind like this, mother,&rdquo; cried the voice
      of Pete, and then the swirling sound in the porch went off with a
      long-drawn whirr, and Cæsar came back alone to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete's wound ached again, but he pressed his hand on the place of it and
      struggled up the glen, dragging Joney behind him. They came to her house
      at last. One half of the thatch lay over the other half; the rafters were
      bare like the ribs of the wreck; the oat-cake peck was rattling on the
      lath; the meal-barrel in the corner was stripped of its lid, and the meal
      was whirling into the air like a waterspout; the dresser was stripped, the
      broken crockery lay on the uncovered floor, and the iron slowrie hanging
      over the place of the fire was swinging and striking against the wall, and
      ringing like a knell. And in the midst of this scene of desolation the
      idiot boy was placidly sleeping on his naked bed, and over it the moon was
      scudding through a tattered sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night wore on, and the company in the kitchen listened long, and
      sometimes heard sounds as of voices crying in the wind, but Pete did not
      return. Then they fell to groaning again, to praying aloud without fear,
      and to confessing their undiscovered sins without shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm searched terrible&mdash;I can see through me,&rdquo; cried Kelly, the
      postman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some were chiefly troubled lest death should fall on them while they were
      in a public-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I keep none,&rdquo; cried Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you wouldn't let us open the door,&rdquo; whined the farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the door had been wide enough for a Bishop, not a soul would have
      stirred. For the first time within anyone's recollection, Nancy Joe was on
      her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord,&rdquo; she prayed, &ldquo;Thou knowest well I don't often bother Thee. But
      save Kate, Lord; oh, save and prasarve my little Kirry! It's twenty years
      and better since I asked anything of Thee before and if Thou wilt only
      take away this wind, I'll promise not to say another prayer for twenty
      years more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it in Manx, woman,&rdquo; moaned Grannie. &ldquo;I always say my prayers in Manx
      as well, and the Lord can listen to the one He knows best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's prayer as well as praise in singing,&rdquo; cried Cæsar; and they began
      to sing, all down on their knees, their eyes tightly closed, and their
      hands clasped before their faces. They sang of heaven and its peaceful
      plains, its blue lakes and sunny skies, its golden cities and emerald
      gates, its temples and its tabernacles, where &ldquo;congregations ne'er break
      up and Sabbaths never end.&rdquo; It was some comfort to drown with the wild
      discord of their own voices the fearful noises of the tempest. When they
      finished the hymn, they began on it again, keeping it up without a break,
      sweeping the dying note of the last word into the rising pitch of the
      first one. In the midst of their singing, they thought a fiercer gust than
      ever was beating on the door, and, to smother the fear of it, they sang
      yet louder. The gust came a second time, and Cæsar cried&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again, brothers,&rdquo; and away they went with another wild whoop through the
      hymn.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came a third time, and Cæsar cried&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once more, beloved,&rdquo; and they raced madly through the hymn again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the door burst open as before a tremendous kick, and Pete, fierce and
      wild-eyed, and green with the drift of the salt foam caked thick on his
      face, stepped over the threshold with the unconscious body of Kate in his
      arms and the idiot boy peering over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank the Lord for an answer to prayer,&rdquo; cried Cæsar. &ldquo;Where did you find
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the tholthan up the glen,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Up in the witch's tholthan.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the second morning afterwards the air was quiet and full of the odour
      of seaweed; the sky was round as the inside of a shell, and pale pink like
      the shadow of flame; the water was smooth and silent; the hills had lost
      the memory of the storm, and land and sea lay like a sleeping child.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this broad and steady morning Kate came back to consciousness. She had
      slid out of delirium into sleep as a boat slides out of the open sea into
      harbour, and when she awoke there was a voice in her ears that seemed to
      be calling to her from the quay. It was a familiar voice, and yet it was
      unfamiliar; it was like the voice of a friend heard for the first time
      after a voyage. It seemed to come from a long way off, and yet to be
      knocking at the very door of her heart. She kept her eyes closed for a
      moment and listened; then she opened them and looked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light was clouded and yet dazzling, as if glazed muslin were shaking
      before her eyes. Grannie was sitting by her bedside, knitting in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you sitting there, mother?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grannie dropped her needles and caught at her apron. &ldquo;Dear heart alive,
      the child's herself again!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anything happened?&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monday morning, bogh, thank the Lord for all His mercies!&rdquo; cried Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The familiar voice came again. It came from the direction of the stairs.
      &ldquo;Who's that?&rdquo; said Kate, whispering fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete himself, Kirry. Aw well! Aw dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete!&rdquo; cried Kate in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, no, woman, but a living man come back again. No fear of him, bogh!
      Not dead at all, but worth twenty dead men yet, and he brought you safe
      out of the storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The storm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the storm, woman. There warn such a storm on the island I don't know
      the years. He found you in the tholthan up the glen. Lost your way in the
      wind, it's like, and no wonder. But let me call father. Father! father!
      Chut! the man's as deaf as little Tom Hommy. Father!&rdquo; called Grannie,
      bustling about at the stair-head in a half-demented way.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some commotion below, and the voice on the stairs was saying, &ldquo;<i>This</i>
      way? No, <i>sir</i>. That way, if <i>you</i> plaze.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D'ye hear him, Kirry?&rdquo; cried Grannie, putting her head back into the
      room. &ldquo;That's the man himself. Sitting on the bottom step same as an ould
      bulldog, and keeping watch that nobody bothers you. The good-naturedst
      bulldog breathing, though, and he hasn't had a wink on the night. Saved
      your life, darling. He did; yes, he did, praise God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At mention of the tholthan, Kate had remembered everything. She dropped
      back on the pillow, and cried, in a voice of pain, &ldquo;Why couldn't he leave
      me to die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grannie chuckled knowingly at that, and wiped her eyes with the corner of
      her apron. &ldquo;The bogh is herself, for sure. When they're wishing themselves
      dead they're always mending father! But I'll go down instead. Lie still,
      bogh, lie still!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Grannie went muffled down the stairs with many &ldquo;Aw dears, aw
      dears!&rdquo; and then crackled from below through the floor and the unceiled
      joists, saying sharply but with a tremor, too, &ldquo;Nancy Joe, why aren't you
      taking a cup of something upstairs, woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness me, Mistress Cregeen, is it true for all?&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course it's true. Do you think a poor child is going fasting for
      ever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; shouted the familiar voice again. &ldquo;Was it herself you were
      spaking to in the dairy loft, Grannie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else, man?&rdquo; said Grannie, and then there was a general tumult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, the joy! Aw, the delight! Gough bless me, Grannie, I was thinking she
      was for spaking no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of the way,&rdquo; cried Nancy, as if pushing past somebody to whip the
      kettle on to the fire. &ldquo;These men creatures have no more rising in their
      hearts than bread without balm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're balm enough yourself, Nancy, for a quiet husband. But lend me a
      hould of the bellows there&mdash;I'll blow up like blazes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar came into the house on the top of this commotion, grumbling as he
      stepped over the porch, &ldquo;The wind has taken half the stacks of my haggard,
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter, sir,&rdquo; shouted Pete. &ldquo;The best of your Melliah is saved
      upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she herself?&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;Praise His name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And over the furious puffing and panting and quacking of the bellows and
      the cracking and roaring of the fire, the voice of Pete came in gusts
      through the floor, crying, &ldquo;I'll go mad with the joy! I will; yes, I will,
      and nobody shall stop me neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The house, which seemed to have been holding its breath since the storm,
      now broke into a ripple of laughter. It began in the kitchen, it ran up
      the stairs, it crept through the chinks in the floor, it went over the
      roof. But Kate lay on her pillow and moaned, and turned her face to the
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Nancy Joe appeared in the bedroom, making herself tidy at the
      doorway with a turn of the hand over her hair. &ldquo;Mercy on me!&rdquo; she cried,
      clapping her hands at the first sight of Kate's face, &ldquo;who was the born
      blockhead that said the girl's wedding was as like to be in the churchyard
      as in the church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's me,&rdquo; said a deep voice from the middle of the stairs, and then
      Nancy clashed the door back and poured Pete into Kate in a broadside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Pete that done it, though,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You can't expect much sense
      of the like, but still and for all he saved your life, Kitty. Dr.
      Mylechreest says so. 'If the girl had been lying out another hour,' says
      he&mdash;&mdash;And, my goodness, the fond of you that man is; it's
      wonderful! Twisting and turning all day yesterday on the bottom step
      yonder same as a live conger on the quay, but looking as soft about the
      eyes as if he'd been a week out of the water. And now! my sakes, <i>now!</i>
      D'ye hear him, Kirry? He's fit to burst the bellows. No use, though&mdash;he's
      a shocking fine young fellow&mdash;he's all that.... But just listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a fissing sound from below, and a sense of burning. &ldquo;What do I
      always say? You can never trust a man to have sense enough to take it off.
      That's the kettle on the boil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy went flopping downstairs, where with furious words she rated Pete,
      who laughed immoderately. Cæsar came next. He had taken off his boots and
      was walking lightly in his stockings; but Kate felt his approach by his
      asthmatic breathing. As he stepped in at the door he cried, in the high
      pitch of the preacher, &ldquo;Praise the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within
      me praise His holy name!&rdquo; Then he fell to the praise of Pete as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He brought you out of the jaws of death and the mouth of Satan. It was a
      sign, Katherine, and we can't do better than follow the Spirit's leading.
      He saved your life, woman, and that's giving him the right to have and to
      hould it. Well, I've only one child in this life, but, if it's the Lord's
      will, I'm willing. He was always my white-headed boy, and he has made his
      independent fortune in a matter of five years' time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The church bell began to toll, and Kate started up and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the Dempster's funeral, Kitty,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;They were for burying
      him to-morrow, but men that drink don't keep. They'll be putting him in
      the family vault at Lezayre with his father, the staunch ould Rechabite.
      Many a good cow has a bad calf, you see, and that's bad news for a man's
      children; but many a good calf is from a bad cow, and that's good news for
      the man himself. It's been the way with Peter anyway, for the Lord has
      delivered him and prospered him, and I'm hearing on the best authority he
      has five thousand golden sovereigns sent home to Mr. Dumbell's bank at
      Douglas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grannie came up with a basin of beef-tea, and Cæsar was hustled out of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come now, bogh; take a spoonful, and I'll lave you to yourself,&rdquo; said
      Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, leave me to myself,&rdquo; said Kate, sipping wearily; and then Grannie
      went off with the basin in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she taken it?&rdquo; said some one below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that, if you plaze,&rdquo; said Grannie in a jubilant tone; and Kate
      knew that the empty basin was being shown around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate lay back on the pillow, listened to the tolling of the bell, and
      shuddered. She thought it a ghostly thing that the first voice she had
      heard on coming as from another world had been the voice of Pete, and the
      first name dinned into her ears had been Pete's name. The procession of
      the Deemster's funeral passed the house, and she closed her eyes and
      seemed to see it&mdash;the coffin on the open cart, the men on horseback
      riding beside it, and then the horses tied up to posts and gates about the
      churchyard, and the crowd of men of all conditions at the grave-side. In
      her mind's eye, Kate was searching through that crowd for somebody. Was <i>he</i>
      there? Had he heard what had happened to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell into a doze, and was awakened by a horse's step on the road, and
      the voices of two men talking as they came nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man alive, the joy I'm taking to see you! The tallygraph? Coorse not.
      Knew I'd find you at the funeral, though.&rdquo; It was Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I meant to come over after it.&rdquo; It was Philip, and Kate's heart stood
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voices were smothered for a moment (as the buzzing is when the bees
      enter the hive), and then began with as sharper ring from the rooms below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's she now, Mrs. Cregeen?&rdquo; said the voice of Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better, sir&mdash;much better,&rdquo; answered Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No return of the unconsciousness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, no,&rdquo; said Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was she&rdquo;&mdash;Kate thought the voice faltered&mdash;&ldquo;was she delirious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not rambling at all,&rdquo; replied Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; said Philip, and Kate felt a long breath of relief go through
      the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't hear of it until this morning,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;The postman told
      me at breakfast-time, and I called on Dr. Mylechreest coming out. If I had
      known&mdash;&mdash;I didn't sleep much last night, anyway; but if I had
      ever imagined&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right good to the girl, sir,&rdquo; said Grannie, and then Kate,
      listening intently, caught a quavering sound of protestation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Deed you are, though, and always have been,&rdquo; said Grannie, &ldquo;and I'm
      saying it before Pete here, that ought to know and doesn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't I, though?&rdquo; came in the other voice&mdash;the resounding voice&mdash;the
      voice full of laughter and tears together. &ldquo;But I do that, Grannie, same
      as if I'd been here and seen it. Lave it to me to know Phil Christian.
      I've summered and wintered the man, haven't I? He's timber that doesn't
      start, mother, blow high, blow low.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate heard another broken sound as of painful protest, and then with a
      sickening sense she covered up her head that she might hear no more.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      She was weak and over-wrought, and she fell asleep as she lay covered.
      While she slept a babel of meaningless voices kept clashing in her ears,
      and her own voice haunted her perpetually. When she awoke it was broad
      morning again, and the house was full of the smell of boiling stock-fish.
      By that she knew it was another day, and the hour of early breakfast. She
      heard the click of cups and saucers on the kitchen table, the step of her
      father coming in from the mill, and then the heartsome voice of Pete
      talking of the changes in the island since he went away. New houses,
      promenades, iron piers, breakwaters, lakes, towers&mdash;wonderful I
      extraordinary! tre-menjous!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the boys&mdash;w here's the Manx boys at all?&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Gone like
      a flight of birds to Austrillya and Cleveland and the Cape, and I don't
      know where. Not a Manx house now that hasn't one of the boys foreign. And
      the houses themselves&mdash;where's the ould houses and the crofts?
      Felled, all felled or boarded up. And the boats&mdash;where's the boats?
      Lying rotting at the top of the harbour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grannie's step came into the kitchen, and Pete's loud voice drooped to a
      whisper. &ldquo;How's herself this morning, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleeping quiet and nice when I came downstairs,&rdquo; said Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will I be seeing her myself to-day, think you?&rdquo; asked Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know in the world, but I'll ask,&rdquo; answered Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're an angel, Grannie,&rdquo; said Pete, &ldquo;a reg'lar ould archangel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate shuddered with a new fear. It was clear that in the eyes of her
      people the old relations with Pete were to stand. Everybody expected her
      to marry Pete; everybody seemed anxious to push the marriage on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grannie came up with her breakfast, pulled aside the blind, and opened the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy will tidy the room a taste,&rdquo; she said coaxingly, &ldquo;and then I
      shouldn't wonder if you'll be sending for Pete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate raised a cry of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, no harm when a girl's poorly,&rdquo; said Grannie, &ldquo;and her promist man for
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate tried to protest and explain, but courage failed her. She only said,
      &ldquo;Not yet, mother. I'm not fit to see him yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no more about it. Not to-day at all&mdash;to-morrow maybe,&rdquo; said
      Grannie, and Kate clutched at the word, and answered eagerly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, tomorrow, mother; to-morrow maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before noon Philip had come again. Kate heard his horse's step on the
      road, trotting hard from the direction of Peel. He drew up at the porch,
      but did not alight, and Grannie went out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll not come in to-day, Mrs. Cregeen,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Does she continue to
      improve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As nice as nice, sir,&rdquo; said Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate crept out of bed, stole to the window, hid behind the curtains, and
      listened intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a mercy all goes well,&rdquo; he said; Kate could hear the heaving of his
      breath. &ldquo;Is Pete about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but gone to Ramsey, sir,&rdquo; said Grannie. &ldquo;It's like you'll meet him if
      you are going on to Ballure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be getting back to business,&rdquo; said Philip, and the horse swirled
      across the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ride from Douglas on purpose, then?&rdquo; said Grannie, and Philip
      answered with an audible effort&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was anxious. What an escape she has had! I could scarcely sleep last
      night for thinking of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate put her hand to her throat to keep back the cry that was bubbling up,
      and her mother's voice came thick and deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord's blessing. Master Philip&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began, but the
      horse's feet stamped out everything as it leapt to a gallop in going off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate listened where she knelt until the last beat of the hoofs had died
      away in the distance, and then she crept back to bed and covered up her
      head in the clothes as before, but with a storm of other feelings. &ldquo;He
      loves me,&rdquo; she told herself with a thrill of the heart. &ldquo;He loves me&mdash;he
      loves me still! And he will never, never, never see me married to anybody
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt an immense relief now, and suddenly found strength to think of
      facing Pete. It even occurred to her to send for him at once, as a first
      step towards removing the impression that the old relations were to
      remain. She would be quiet, she would be cold, she would show by her
      manner that Pete was impossible, she would break the news gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete came like the light at Nancy's summons. Kate heard him on the stairs
      whispering with Nancy and breathing heavily. Nancy was hectoring it over
      him and pulling him about to make him presentable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; whispered Nancy, &ldquo;take the redyng comb and lash your hair out,
      it's all through-others. And listen&mdash;you've got to be quiet. Promise
      me you'll be quiet. She's wake and low and nervous, so no kissing. D'ye
      hear me now, no kissing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, kissing makes no noise to spake of, woman,&rdquo; whispered Pete; and then
      he was in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate saw him come, a towering dark figure between her and the door. He did
      not speak at first, but slid down to the chair at the foot of the bed,
      modestly, meekly, reverently, as if he had entered a sanctuary. His hand
      rested on his knee, and she noticed that the wrist was hairy and tattooed
      with the three legs of Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you, Pete?&rdquo; she asked; and then he said in a low tone, almost in a
      whisper, as if speaking to himself in a hush of awe&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's her own voice again! I've heard it in my drames these five years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked helplessly about him for a moment, fixed his watery eyes on
      Nancy as if he wanted to burst into sobs but dare not for fear of the
      noise, then turned on his chair and seemed on the point of taking to
      flight. But just at that instant his dog, which had followed him into the
      room, planted its forelegs on the counterpane and looked impudently into
      Kate's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down, Dempster, down!&rdquo; cried Pete; and after that, the ice being broken
      by the sound of his voice, Pete was his own man once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your dog, Pete?&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, no, Kate, but I'm his man,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;He does what he likes with
      me, anyway. Caught me out in Kimber-ley and fetched me home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he old?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old, d'ye say? He's one of the lost ten tribes of dogs, and behaves as if
      he'd got to inherit the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt Pete's big black eyes shining on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gracious, Kitty, what a woman you're growing, though!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I so much changed?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Changed, is it?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Gough bless me heart! the nice little thing
      you were when we used to play fishermen together down at Cornaa Harbour&mdash;d'ye
      remember? The ould kipper-box rolling on a block for a boat at sea&mdash;do
      you mind it? Yourself houlding a bit of a broken broomstick in the rope
      handle for a mast, and me working the potato-dibber on the ground, first
      port and then starboard, for rudder and wind and oar and tide. 'Mortal
      dirty weather this, cap'n?' 'Aw, yes, woman, big sea extraordinary'&mdash;d'ye
      mind it, Kirry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate tried to laugh a little and to say what a long time ago it was since
      then. But Pete, being started, laughed uproariously, slapped his knee, and
      rattled on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up at the mill, too&mdash;d'ye remember that now? Yourself with the top
      of a barrel for a flower basket, holding it 'kimbo at your lil hip and
      shouting, 'Violets! Swate violets! Fresh violets!'&rdquo; (He mocked her silvery
      treble in his lusty baritone and roared with laughter.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then me, woman, d'ye mind me?&mdash;me, with the pig-stye gate atop
      of my head for a fish-board, yelling, 'Mackerel! Fine ladies, fresh
      ladies, and bellies as big as bishops&mdash;Mack-er-el!' Aw, Kirry, Kirry!
      Aw, the dear ould times gone by! Aw, the changes, the changes!... Did I <i>know</i>
      you then? Are you asking me did I know you when I found you in the glen?
      Did I know I was alive, Kitty? Did I know the wind was howling? Did I know
      my head was going round like a compass, and my heart thumping a hundred
      and twenty pound to the square inch? Did I kiss you and kiss you while you
      were lying there useless, and lift you up and hitch your poor limp arms
      around my neck, and carry you out of the dirty ould tholthan that was
      going to be the death of you&mdash;the first job I was doing on the
      island, too, coming back to it.... Lord save us, Kitty, what have I done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate had dropped back on the pillow, and was sobbing as if her heart would
      break, and seeing this, Nancy fell on Pete with loud reproaches, took the
      man by the shoulders and his dog by the neck, and pushed both out of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of it,&rdquo; cried Nancy. &ldquo;Didn't I tell you to be quiet? You great
      blethering omathaun, you shall come no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Abashed, ashamed, humiliated, and quiet enough now, Pete went slowly down
      the stairs.

    <h2>
      XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Late that night Kate heard Cæsar and her mother talking together as they
      were going to bed. Cæsar was saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got him on the track of a good house, and he went off to Ramsey this
      morning to put a sight on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear heart alive, father!&rdquo; Grannie answered, &ldquo;Pete isn't home till a week
      come Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young man is warm on the wedding,&rdquo; said Cæsar, &ldquo;and he has money, and
      store is no sore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the girl's not fit for it, 'deed she isn't,&rdquo; said Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she's wake,&rdquo; said Cæsar, &ldquo;shell be no worse for saying 'I will,' and
      when she's said it she'll have time enough to get better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate trembled with fear. The matter of her marriage with Pete was going on
      without her. A sort of supernatural power seemed to be pushing it along.
      Nobody asked if she wished it, nobody questioned that she did so. It was
      taken for granted that the old relations would stand. As soon as she could
      go about she would be expected to marry Pete. Pete himself would expect
      it, because he believed he had her promise; her mother would expect it,
      because she had always thought of it as a thing understood; her father
      would expect it, because Pete's prosperity had given him a new view of
      Pete's piety and pedigree; and Nancy Joe would expect it, too, if only
      because she was still haunted by her old bugbear, the dark shadow of Ross
      Christian. There was only one way to break down these expectations, and
      that was to speak out. But how was a girl to speak? What was she to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate pretended to be ill. Three days longer she lay, like a hunted wolf in
      its hole, keeping her bed from sheer dread of the consequences of leaving
      it. The fourth day was Sunday. It was morning, and the church bells were
      ringing. Cæsar had shouted from his bedroom for some one to tie his bow,
      then for some one to button his black gloves. He had gone off at length
      with the footsteps of the people stepping round to chapel. The first hymn
      had been started, and its doleful notes were trailing through the mill
      walls. Kate was propped up in bed, and the window of her room was open.
      Over the droning of the hymn she caught the sound of a horse's hoofs on
      the road. They stopped at a little distance, and then came on again, with
      the same two voices as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete was talking with great eagerness. &ldquo;Plenty of house, aw plenty,
      plenty,&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;Elm Cottage they're calling it&mdash;the slate
      one with the ould fir-tree behind the Coort House and by the lane to
      Claughbane. Dry as a bone and clane as a gull's wing. You could lie with
      your back to the wall and ate off the floor. Taps inside and water as
      white as gin. I've been buying the cabin of the 'Mona's Isle' for a
      summer-house in the garden. Got a figurehead for the porch too, and I'll
      have an anchor for the gate before I'm done. Aw, I'm bound to have
      everything nice for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a short silence, in which nothing was heard but the step of the
      horse, and then Philip said in a faltering voice, &ldquo;But isn't this being
      rather in a hurry, Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Short coorting's the best coorting, and ours has been long enough
      anyway,&rdquo; said Pete. They had drawn up at the porch, and Pete's laugh came
      in at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But think how weak she is,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;She hasn't even-left her bed
      yet, has she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, of coorse, sartenly,&rdquo; said Pete, in a steadier voice, &ldquo;if the
      girl isn't fit&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's so sudden, you see,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;Has she&mdash;has she&mdash;consented?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to say consented&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Pete; and Philip took him up
      and said quickly, eagerly, hotly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She can't&mdash;I'm sure she can't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence again, broken only by the horse's impatient pawing, and
      then Philip said more calmly, &ldquo;Let Dr. Mylechreest see her first, at all
      events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not a man for skinning the meadow to the sod, no&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said
      Pete, in a doleful tone; but Kate heard no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was trembling with a new thought. It was only a shadowy suggestion as
      yet, and at first she tried to beat it back. But it came again, it forced
      itself upon her, it mastered her, she could not resist it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way to break the fate that was pursuing her was to make <i>Philip</i>
      speak out! The way to stop the marriage with Pete was to compel Philip to
      marry her! He thought she would never consent to marry Pete&mdash;what if
      he were given to understand that she had consented. That was the way to
      gain the victory over Philip, the way to punish him!
    </p>
    <p>
      He would not blame her&mdash;he would lay the blame at the door of chance,
      of fate, of her people. He would think they were forcing this marriage
      upon her&mdash;the mother out of love of Pete, the father out of love of
      Pete's money, and Nancy out of fear of Ross Christian. He would know that
      she could not struggle because she could not speak. He would believe she
      was yielding against her will, in spite of her love, in the teeth of their
      intention. He would think of her as a victim, as a martyr, as a sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a deceit&mdash;a small deceit; it looked so harmless, too&mdash;so
      innocent, almost humorous, half ridiculous; and she was a woman, and she
      could not put it away. Love, love, love! It would be her excuse and her
      forgiveness. She had appealed to Philip himself and in vain. Now she would
      pretend to go on with her old relations. It was so little to do, and the
      effects were so certain. In jealousy and in terror Philip would step out
      of himself and claim her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had craft&mdash;all hungry things have craft. She had inklings of
      ambition, a certain love of luxury, and desire to be a lady. To get Philip
      was to get everything. Love would be satisfied, ambition fulfilled, the
      aims of refinement reached. Why not risk the great stake?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy came to tidy the room, and Kate said, &ldquo;Where's Pete all this time, I
      wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sitting in the fire-seat this half-hour,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;I don't know in
      the world what's come over the man. He's rocking and moaning there like a
      cow licking a dead calf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would he like to come up, think you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ask the man twice if you want him to say no,&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blushing and stammering, and trying to straighten his black curls, Pete
      came at Nancy's call.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate had few qualms. The wound she had received from Philip had left her
      conscienceless towards Pete. Yet she turned her head a little sideways as
      she welcomed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you better, then, Kirry?&rdquo; said Pete timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm nearly as well as ever,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, though?&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Then you'll be down soon, it's like, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so, Pete&mdash;quite soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And fit for anything, now&mdash;yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, fit for anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete laughed from his heart like a boy. &ldquo;I'll take a slieu round to
      Ballure and tell Philip immadiently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip?&rdquo; said Kate, with a look of inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was saying this morning you wouldn't be equal to it, Kirry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Equal to what, Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Getting&mdash;going&mdash;having&mdash;that's to say&mdash;well, you
      know, putting a sight on the parson himself one of these days, that's the
      fact.&rdquo; And, to cover his confusion, Pete laughed till the scraas of the
      roof began to snip.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's pause, and then Kate said, with a cough and a stammer
      and her head aside, &ldquo;Is that so <i>very</i> tiring, Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete leapt from his chair and laughed again like a man demented. &ldquo;D'ye say
      so, Kitty? The word then, darling&mdash;the word in my ear&mdash;as soft
      as soft&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was leaning over the bed, but Kate drew away from him, and Nancy pulled
      him back, saying, &ldquo;Get off with you, you goosey gander! What for should
      you bother a poor girl to know if sugar's sweet, and if she's willing to
      change a sweetheart for a husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was done. One act&mdash;nay, half an act; a word&mdash;nay, no word at
      all, but only silence. The daring venture was afoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grannie came up with Kate's dinner that day, kissed her on both cheeks,
      felt them hot, wagged her head wisely, and whispered, &ldquo;I know&mdash;you
      needn't tell <i>me!</i>&rdquo;

      XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The last hymn was sung, Cæsar came home from chapel, changed back from his
      best to his work-day clothes, and then there was talking and laughing in
      the kitchen amid the jingling of plates and the vigorous rattling of
      knives and forks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phil must be my best man,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;He'll be back to Douglas now, but
      I'll get you to write me a line, Cæsar, and ask him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hold with long engagements, Pete?&rdquo; said Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A week,&rdquo; said Pete, with the air of a judge; &ldquo;not much less anyway&mdash;not
      of a rule, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You goose,&rdquo; cried Nancy, &ldquo;it must be three Sundays for the banns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then John the Clerk shall get them going this evening,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Nancy
      had the pull of me there, Grannie. Not being in the habit of getting
      married, I clane forgot about the banns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John the Clerk came in the afternoon, and there was some lusty
      disputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must have bridesmaids and wedding-cakes, Pete&mdash;it's only proper,&rdquo;
       said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, yes, and tobacco and rum, and everything respectable,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the parson&mdash;mind it's the parson now,&rdquo; said Grannie; &ldquo;none of
      their nasty high-bailiffs. I don't know in the world how a dacent woman
      can rest in her bed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, the parson, of coorse&mdash;and the parson's wife, maybe,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can manage it for you for to-morrow fortnight,&rdquo; said John the
      Clerk impressively, and there was some clapping of hands, quickly
      suppressed by Cæsar, with mutterings of&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Popery! clane Popery, sir! Can't a person commit matrimony without a
      parson bothering a man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Cæsar squared his elbows across the table and wrote the letter to
      Philip. Pete never stood sponsor for anything so pious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Respected and Honoured Sir,&mdash;I write first to thee that it hath been
      borne in on my mind (strong to believe the Lord hath spoken) to marry on
      Katherine Cregeen, only beloved daughter of Cæsar Cregeen, a respectable
      man and a local preacher, in whose house I tarry, being free to use all
      his means of grace. Wedding to-morrow fortnight at Kirk Christ, Lezayre,
      eleven o'clock forenoon, and the Lord make it profitable to my soul.&mdash;With
      love and-reverence, thy servant, and I trust the Lord's, Peter Quilliam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having written this, Cæsar read it aloud with proper elevation of pitch.
      Grannie wiped her eyes, and Pete said, &ldquo;Indited beautiful, sir&mdash;only
      you haven't asked him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My pen's getting crosslegs,&rdquo; said Cæsar, &ldquo;but that'll do for an N.B.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N. B.&mdash;Will you come for my best man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there was more talk and more laughter. &ldquo;You're a lucky fellow, Pete,&rdquo;
       said Pete himself. &ldquo;My sailor, you are, though. She's as sweet as clover
      with the bumbees humming over it, and as warm as a gorse bush when the
      summer's gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, affection being infectious beyond all maladies known to mortals,
      Nancy Joe was heard to say, &ldquo;I believe in my heart I must be having a man
      myself before long, or I'll be losing the notion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D'ye hear that, boys?&rdquo; shouted Pete. &ldquo;Don't all spake at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late&mdash;I've lost it,&rdquo; said Nancy, and there was yet more
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      To put an end to this frivolity, Cæsar raised a hymn, and they sang it
      together with cheerful voices. Then Cæsar prayed appropriately, John the
      Clerk improvised responses, and Pete went out and sat on the bottom step
      in the lobby and smoked up the stairs, so that Kate in the bedroom should
      not feel too lonely.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Kate, overwhelmed with shame, humiliation, self-reproach, horror
      of herself, and dread of everything, lay with cheeks ablaze and her head
      buried in the bedclothes. She had no longer any need to pretend to be
      sick; she was now sick in reality. Fate had threatened her. She had
      challenged it. They were gambling together. The stake was her love, her
      life, her doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the next day she had worked herself into a nervous fever. Dr.
      Mylechreest came to see her, unbidden of the family. He was one of those
      tall, bashful men who, in their eagerness to be gone, seem always to have
      urgent business somewhere else. After a single glance at her and a few
      muttered syllables, he went off hurriedly, as if some one were waiting for
      him round the corner. But on going downstairs he met Cæsar, who asked him
      how he found her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feverish, very; keep her in bed,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;As for this marriage, it
      must be put off. She's exciting herself, and I won't answer for the
      consequences. The thing has fallen too suddenly. To tell you the truth&mdash;this
      way, Mr. Cregeen&mdash;I am afraid of a malady of the brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, doctor,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, if you know better. Good-day! But let the wedding wait. <i>Traa
      dy liooar</i>&mdash;time enough, Mr. Cregeen. A right good Manx maxim for
      once. Put it off&mdash;put it off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not my putting off, doctor. What can you do with a man that's
      wanting to be married? You can't bridle a horse with pincers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when the doctor was gone, Cæsar said to Grannie, &ldquo;Cut out the
      bridesmaids and the wedding-cakes and the fiddles and the foolery, and let
      the girl be married immadiently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear heart alive, father, what's all the hurry?&rdquo; said Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Lord bless my soul, what's all the fuss?&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;First one
      objecting this, then another objecting that, as if everybody was
      intarmined to stop the thing. It's going on, I'm telling you; d'ye hear
      me? There's many a slip&mdash;but no matter. What's written with the pen
      can't be cut out with the axe, so lave it alone, the lot of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate was in an ecstasy of exultation. The doctor had been sent by Philip.
      It was Philip who was trying to stop the marriage. He would never be able
      to bear it; he would claim her soon. It might be to-day, it might be
      to-morrow, it might be the next day. The odds were with her. Fate was
      being worsted. Thus she clung to her blind faith that Philip would
      intervene.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was Monday, and on Tuesday morning Philip came again. He was very
      quiet, but the heart has ears, and Kate heard him. Pete's letter had
      reached him, and she could see his white face. After a few words of
      commonplace conversation, he drew Pete out of the house. What had he got
      to say? Was he thinking that Pete must be stopped at all hazards? Was he
      about to make a clean breast of it? Was he going to tell all? Impossible!
      He could not; he dared not; it was <i>her</i> secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete came back to the house alone, looking serious and even sad. Kate
      heard him exchange a few words with her father as they passed through the
      lobby to the kitchen. Cæsar was saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand on your own head, sir, that's my advice to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the intensity of her torment she could not rest. She sent for Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Philip?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Is he coming? What has he been telling
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad news, Kate&mdash;very bad,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a fearful silence for a moment. It was like the awful hush at
      the instant when the tide turns, and you feel as if something has happened
      to the world. Then Kate hardened her face and said, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's ill, and wants to go away in a week. He can't come to the wedding,''
      said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; said Kate. Her heart leapt for joy. She could not help it&mdash;she
      laughed. She saw through Philip's excuse. It was only his subterfuge&mdash;he
      thought Pete would not marry without him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, but you never seen the like, though, Kirry,&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;he was that
      white and wake and narvous. Work and worry, that's the size of it. There's
      nothing done in this world without paying the price of it, and that's as
      true as gospel. 'The sea's calling me, Pete,' says he, and then he
      laughed, but it was the same as if a ghost itself was grinning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the selfishness of her enfeebled spirit, Kate still rejoiced. Philip
      was suffering. It was another assurance that he would come to her relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When does he go?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Tuesday,&rdquo; answered Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't there a way of getting a Bishop's license to marry in a week?&rdquo; said
      Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will you, though?&rdquo; said Pete, with a shout of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Philip first. No use changing if Philip can't come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall&mdash;he must. I won't take No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may kiss me now,&rdquo; said Kate, and Pete plucked her up into his arms
      and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was heart-dead to him yet, from the wound that Philip had dealt her,
      but at the touch of his lips a feeling of horror seemed to cramp all her
      limbs. With a shudder she crept down in the bed and hid her face, hating
      herself, loathing herself, wishing herself dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood a moment by her side, crying like a big boy in his great
      happiness. &ldquo;I don't know in the world what she sees in me to be so fond of
      me, but that's the way with the women always, God bless them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not lift her face, and he stepped quietly to the door. Half-way
      through he turned about and raised one arm over his head. &ldquo;God's rest and
      God's peace be with you, and may the man that gets you keep a clane heart
      and a clane hand, and be fit for the good woman he's won for his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the next minute he went tearing down the stairs, and the kitchen rang
      with his laughter.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fate scored one. Kate had been telling herself that Philip was tired of
      her, that he did not love her any longer, that having taken all he could
      take he desired to be done with her, that he was trying to forget her, and
      that she was a drag upon him, when suddenly she remembered the tholthan,
      and bethought herself for the first time of a possible contingency. Why
      had she not thought of it before? Why had <i>he</i> never thought of it?
      <i>If</i> it should come to pass! The prospect did not appal her; it did
      not overwhelm her with confusion or oppress her with shame; it did not
      threaten to fall like a thunderbolt; the thought of it came down like an
      angel's whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not afraid. It was only an idea, only a possibility, only a dream
      of consequences, but at one bound it brought her so much nearer to Philip.
      It gave her a right to him. How dare he make her suffer so? She would not
      permit him to leave her. He was her husband, and he must cling to her,
      come what would. Across the void that had divided them a mysterious power
      drew them together. She was he, and he was she, and they were one, for&mdash;who
      knows?&mdash;who could say?&mdash;perhaps Nature herself had willed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the first effect of the new thought upon Kate was frenzied
      exultation. She had only one thing to do now. She had only to go to Philip
      as Bathsheba went to David. True, she could not say what Bathsheba said.
      She had no certainty, but her case was no less strong. &ldquo;Have you never
      thought of what may possibly occur?&rdquo; This is what she would say now to
      Philip. And Philip would say to her, &ldquo;Dearest, I have never thought of
      that. Where was my head that I never reflected?&rdquo; Then, in spite of his
      plans, in spite of his pledge to Pete, in spite of the world, in spite of
      himself&mdash;yea, in spite of his own soul if it stood between them&mdash;he
      would cling to her; she was sure of it&mdash;she could swear to it&mdash;he
      could not resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will believe whatever I tell him,&rdquo; she thought, and she would say,
      &ldquo;Come to me, Philip; I am frightened.&rdquo; In the torture of her palpitating
      heart she would have rejoiced at that moment if she could have been sure
      that she was in the position of what the world calls a shameful woman.
      With that for her claim she could see herself going to Philip and telling
      him, her head on his breast, whispering sweetly the great secret&mdash;the
      wondrous news. And then the joy, the rapture, the long kiss of love!
      &ldquo;Mine, mine, mine! he is mine at last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That could not be quite so; she was not so happy as Bathsheba; she was not
      sure, but her right was the same for all that. Oh, it was joyful, it was
      delicious!
    </p>
    <p>
      The little cunning arts of her sex, the small deceits in which she had
      disguised herself fell away from her now. She said to herself, &ldquo;I will
      stop the nonsense about the marriage with Pete.&rdquo; It was mean, it was
      foolish, it was miserable trifling, it was wicked, it was a waste of life&mdash;above
      all, it was doing a great, great wrong to her love of Philip! How could
      she ever have thought of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning she was up and was dressing when Grannie came into the room
      with a cup of tea. &ldquo;I feel so much better,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;that I think I'll go
      to Douglas by the coach today, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do, bogh,&rdquo; said Grannie cheerfully, &ldquo;and Pete shall go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; I must be quite alone, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, aw! A lil errand, maybe! Shopping is it? Presents, eh? Take your tay,
      then.&rdquo; And Grannie rolled the blind, saying, &ldquo;A beautiful morning you'll
      have for it, too. I can see the spire as plain as plain.&rdquo; Then, turning
      about, &ldquo;Did you hear the bells this morning, Kitty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what bells, mammy?&rdquo; said Kate, through a mouthful of bread and
      butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bells for Christian Killip. Her old sweetheart took her to church at
      last. He wouldn't get rest at your father till he did&mdash;and her baby
      two years for Christmas. But what d'ye think, now? Robbie left her at the
      church door, and he's off by the Ramsey packet for England. Aw, dear, he
      did, though. 'You can make me marry her,' said he, 'but you can't make me
      live with her,' he said, and he was away down the road like the dust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think I'll go to Douglas to-day, mother,&rdquo; said Kate in a broken
      voice. &ldquo;I'm not so very well, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, the bogh!&rdquo; said Grannie. &ldquo;Making too sure of herself, was she? It's
      the way with them all when they're mending.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With cheerful protestations Grannie helped her back to bed, and then went
      off with an anxious face to tell Cæsar that she was more ill than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was ill indeed; but her worst illness was of the heart. &ldquo;If I go to
      him and tell him,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;he will marry me&mdash;yes. No fear that
      he will leave me at the church door or elsewhere. He will stay with me. We
      will be man and wife to the last. The world will know nothing. But <i>I</i>
      will know. As long as I live I will remember that he only sacrificed
      himself to repair a fault That shall never be&mdash;never, never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar came up in great alarm. He seemed to be living in hourly dread that
      some obstacle would arise at the last moment to stop the marriage. &ldquo;Chut,
      woman!&rdquo; he said play-. fully. &ldquo;Have a good heart, Kitty. The sun's not
      going down on you yet at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night there were loud voices from the bar-room. The talk was of the
      marriage which had taken place in the morning, and of its strange and
      painful sequel. John the Clerk was saying, &ldquo;But you'd be hearing of the
      by-child, it's like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never a word,&rdquo; said somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not heard of it, though? Fetching the child to the wedding to have the
      bad name taken off it&mdash;no? They were standing the lil bogh&mdash;-it's
      only three&mdash;two is it, Grannie, only two?&mdash;well, they were
      standing the lil thing under its mother's perricut while the sarvice was
      saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, truth enough, sir! It's the ould Manx way of legitimating. The
      parsons are knowing nothing of it, but I've seen it times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John's right,&rdquo; said Mr. Jelly; &ldquo;and I can tell you more&mdash;it was just
      <i>that</i> the man went to church for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't trust,&rdquo; said John the Clerk. &ldquo;The woman wasn't getting much of a
      husband out of it anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Pete&mdash;he had not spoken before&mdash;&ldquo;but the child was
      getting the name of its father, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not mountains of thick porridge, sir,&rdquo; said somebody. &ldquo;Bobbie's
      gone. What's the good of a father if he's doing nothing to bring you up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask your son if you've got any of the sort,&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;some of you
      have. Ask me. I know middling well what it is to go through the world
      without a father's name to my back. If your lad is like myself, he's
      knowing it early and he's knowing it late. He's knowing it when he's
      saying his bits of prayers atop of the bed in the gable loft: 'God bless
      mother&mdash;and grandmother,' maybe&mdash;there's never no 'father' in
      his little texes. And he's knowing it when he's growing up to a lump of a
      lad and going for a trade, and the beast of life is getting the grip of
      him. Ten to one he comes to be a waistrel then, and, if it's a girl
      instead, a hundred to nothing she turns out a&mdash;well, worse. Only a
      notion, is it? Just a parzon's lie, eh? Having your father's name is
      nothing&mdash;no? That's what the man says. But ask the <i>child</i>, and
      shut your mouth for a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a hush and a hum after that, and Kate, who had reached from the
      bed to open the door, clutched it with a feverish grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Christian Killip is nothing but a trollop, anyway, sir,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every cat is black in the night, father&mdash;the girl's in trouble,&rdquo;
       said Pete. &ldquo;No, no! If I'd done wrong by a woman, and she was having a
      child by me, I'd marry her if she'd take me, though I'd come to hate her
      like sin itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grannie in the kitchen was wiping her eyes at these brave words, but Kate
      in the bedroom was tossing in a delirium of wrath. &ldquo;Never, never, never!&rdquo;
       she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, yes, Philip would marry her if she imposed herself upon him, if she
      hinted at a possible contingency. He, too, was a brave man; he also had a
      lofty soul&mdash;he would not shrink. But no, not for the wealth of
      worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip loved her, and his love alone should bring him to her side. No
      other compulsion should be put upon him, neither the thought of her
      possible future position, nor of the consequences to another. It was the
      only justice, the only safety, the only happiness now or in the time to
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall marry me for <i>my</i> sake,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;for my own sake&mdash;my
      own sake only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus in the wild disorder of her soul&mdash;the tempest of conflicting
      passions&mdash;her pride barred up the one great way.

    <h2>
      XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was no help for it after all&mdash;she must go on as she had begun,
      with the old scheme, the old chance, the old gambling hazard. Heart-sick
      and ashamed, waiting for Philip, and listening to every step, she kept her
      room two days longer. Then Cæsar came and rallied her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gough bless me, but nobody will credit it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The marriage for
      Monday, and the bride in bed a Wednesday. People will say it isn't coming
      off at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This alarmed her. It partly explained why Philip did not come. If he
      thought there was no danger of the marriage, he would be in no hurry to
      intervene. Next day (Thursday) she struggled up and dressed in a light
      wrapper, feeling weak and nervous, and looking pale and white like
      apple-blossom nipped by frost. Pete would have carried her downstairs, but
      she would not have it. They established her among a pile of cushions
      before a fire in the parlour, with its bowl of sea-birds' eggs that had
      the faint, unfamiliar smell&mdash;its tables of old china that shook and
      rang slightly with every step and sound. The kitchen was covered with the
      litter of dressmakers preparing for the wedding. There were bodices to try
      on, and decisions to give on points of style. Kate agreed to everything.
      In a weak and toneless voice she kept on telling them to do as they
      thought hest. Only when she heard that Pete was to pay did she assert her
      will, and that was to limit the dresses to one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sakes alive now, Kirry,&rdquo; cried Nancy, &ldquo;that's what I call ruining a good
      husband&mdash;the man was willing to buy frocks for a boarding-school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete came, sat on a stool at her feet, and told stories. They were funny
      stories of his life abroad, and now and again there came bursts of
      laughter from the kitchen, where they were straining their necks to catch
      his words through the doors, which they kept ajar. But Kate hardly
      listened. She showed signs of impatience sometimes, and made quick glances
      around when the door opened, as if expecting somebody. On recovering
      herself at these moments, she found Pete looking up at her with the big,
      serious, moist eyes of a dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to tell of the house he had taken, to excuse himself for not
      consulting her, and to describe the progress of the furnishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've put it all in the hands of Cannell &amp; Quayle, Kitty,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;and they're doing it beautiful. Marble slabs, bless you, like a butcher's
      counter; carpets as soft as daisies, and looking-glasses as tall as a
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate had not heard him. She was trying to remember all she knew of the
      courts of the island&mdash;where they were held, and on what days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen Philip lately?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not since Monday,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;He's in Douglas, working like mad to be
      here on Monday, God bless him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say when he heard we had changed the day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wanted to get out of it first. 'I'm sailing on Tuesday,' said he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you tell him that <i>I</i> proposed it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust me for not forgetting that at all. 'Aw, then,' says he, 'there's no
      choice left,' he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate's pale face became paler, the dark circles about her eyes grew yet
      more dark. &ldquo;I think I'll go back to bed, mother,&rdquo; she said in the same
      toneless voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete helped her to the foot of the stairs. The big, moist eyes were
      looking at her constantly. She found it hard to keep an equal countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will you be fit for it, darling?&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course she'll be fit, sir,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;What girl is ever more
      than middling the week before she's married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day she persuaded her father to take her to Douglas. She had little
      errands there that could not be done in Ramsey. The morning was fine but
      cold. Pete helped her up in the gig, and they drove away. If only she
      could see Philip, if only Philip could see her, he would know by the look
      of her face that the marriage was not of her making&mdash;that compulsion
      of some sort was being put on her. She spent four hours going from shop to
      shop, lingering in the streets, but seeing nothing of Philip. Her step was
      slow and weary, her features were pinched and starved, but Cæsar could
      scarcely get her out of the town. At length the daylight began to fail,
      and then she yielded to his importunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How short the days are now,&rdquo; she said with a sigh, as they ran into the
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they are a cock's stride shorter in September,&rdquo; said Cæsar; &ldquo;but
      when a woman once gets shopping, Midsummer day itself won't do&mdash;she's
      wanting the land of the midnight sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete lifted her out of the gig in darkness at the door of the &ldquo;Fairy,&rdquo;
       and, his great arms being about her, he carried her into the house and set
      her down in the fire-seat. She would have struggled to her feet if she had
      been able; she felt something like repulsion at his touch; but he looked
      at her with the mute eloquence of love, and she was ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was full of gossips that night. They talked of the marriage
      customs of old times. One described the &ldquo;pay-weddings,&rdquo; where the hat went
      round, and every guest gave something towards the cost of the breakfast
      and the expenses of beginning housekeeping&mdash;rude forefather of the
      practice of the modern wedding present. Another pictured the irregular
      marriages made in public-houses in the days when the island had three
      breweries and thirty drinking shops to every thousand of its inhabitants.
      The publican laid two sticks crosswise on the floor, and said to the bride
      and bridegroom&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hop over the sticks and lie crossed on the floor, And you're man and wife
      for nevermore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was some laughter at this, but Kate sat in the fire-seat and sipped
      her tea in silence, and Pete said quietly, &ldquo;Nothing to laugh at, though. I
      remember a girl over Foxal way that was married to a man like that, and
      then he went off to Kinsale, and got kept for the herring riots&mdash;d'ye
      mind them? She was a strapping girl, though, and when the man was gone the
      boys came bothering her, first one and then another, and good ones among
      them too. And honour bright for all, they were for taking her to the
      parzon about right But no! Did they think she was for committing beggamy?
      She was married to one man, and wasn't that enough for a dacent girl
      anyway. And so she wouldn't and she didn't, and last of all her own boy
      came back, and they lived together man and wife, and what for shouldn't
      they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This question from the man who was on the point of going to church was
      received with shouts of laughter, through which the voice of Grannie rose
      in affectionate remonstrance, saying, &ldquo;Aw, Pete, it's ter'ble to hear you,
      bogh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's there ter'ble about that, Grannie?&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Isn't it the
      Almighty and not the parzon that makes the marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, boy veen, boy veen,&rdquo; cried Grannie, &ldquo;you was used to be a good man,
      but you have fell off very bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate was in a fever of eagerness. She wanted to open her heart to Pete, to
      beg him to spare her, to tell him that it was impossible that they should
      ever marry. Pete would see that Philip was her husband by every true law,
      human and divine. In this mood she lived through much of the following
      day, Friday, tossing and turning in bed, for the exhaustion of the day in
      Douglas had confined her to her room again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening she came downstairs, and was established in the fire-seat
      as before. There were four or five old women in the kitchen spinning yarn
      for a set of blankets which Grannie intended for a wedding present. &ldquo;When
      the day's work was nearly done, two or three old men, the old husbands of
      the old women, came to carry their wheels home again. Then, as the wheels
      whirred for the last of the twist, Pete set the old crones to tell stories
      of old times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us of the days when you were young, Anne,&rdquo; said Pete to an ancient
      dame of eighty. Her husband of eighty-four sat sucking his pipe by her
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said old Anne, stretching her arms to the yarn, &ldquo;I was as near
      going foreign, same as yourself, sir, just as near, now, as makes no
      matter. It was the very day I married this man, and his brother was making
      a start for Austrillya. Jemmy was my ould sweetheart, only I had given him
      up because he was always stealing my pocket-handkerchers. But he came that
      morning and tapped at my window, and 'Will you come, Anne?' says he, and I
      whipped on my perricut and stole out and down to the quay with him. But my
      heart was losing me when I saw the white horses on the water, and home I
      came and went to church with this one instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While old Anne told her story her old husband opened his mouth wider and
      wider, until the pipe-shank dropped out of his toothless gums on to his
      waistcoat. Then he stretched his left arm and brought down his clenched
      hand with a bang on to her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you been living with me better than sixty years,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and
      never telling me that before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete tried to pacify his ancient jealousy, but it was not to be appeased,
      and he shouldered the wheel and hobbled off, saying, &ldquo;And I sent out two
      pound five to put a stone on the man's grave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was loud laughter when the old couple were gone, but Pete said,
      nevertheless, &ldquo;A sacret's a sacret, though, and the ould lady had no right
      to tell it. It was the dead man's sacret too, and she's fouled the ould
      man's memory. If a person's done wrong, the best thing he can do next is
      to say darned little about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate rose and went off to bed. Another door had been barred to her, and
      she felt sick and faint.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day was Saturday. Kate remembered that Philip came to Ballure on
      Saturdays. She felt sure that he would come to Sulby also. Let him only
      set eyes on her, and he would divine the trouble that had taken the colour
      out of her cheeks. Then he would speak to Pete and to her father; he would
      deliver her; he would take everything upon himself. Thus all day long,
      like a white-eyed gambler who has staked his last, she waited and listened
      and watched. At breakfast she said to herself, &ldquo;He will come this
      morning.&rdquo; At dinner, &ldquo;He will come this evening.&rdquo; At supper, &ldquo;He will come
      tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Philip did not come, and she grew hysterical as well as restless. She
      watched the clock; the minutes passed with feet of lead, but the hours
      with wings of fire. She was now like a criminal looking for a reprieve.
      Every time the clock warned to strike, she felt one hour nearer her doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strain was wearing her out. She reproached Philip for leaving her to
      this cruel uncertainty, and she suffered the pangs of one who tries at the
      same time to love and to hate. Then she reproached herself with altering
      the date of the marriage, and excused Philip on the grounds of her haste.
      She felt like a witch who was burning by her own spell. Hope was failing
      her, and Will was breaking down as well. Nevertheless, she determined that
      the wedding should be postponed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was on Saturday night. On Sunday morning she had gone one step
      farther. The last pitiful shred of expectation that Philip would intervene
      seemed then to be lost, and she had resolved that, come what would, she
      should not marry at all. No need to appeal to Pete; no necessity to betray
      the secret of Philip. All she had to do was to say she would not go on
      with the wedding, and no power on earth should compel her.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this determination, and a feeling of immense relief, she went
      downstairs. Cæsar was coming in from the preaching-room, and Pete from the
      new house at Ramsey. They sat down to dinner. After dinner she would speak
      out. Cæsar sharpened the carving-knife on the steel, and said, &ldquo;We've
      taken the girl Christian Killip back to communion to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing,&rdquo; said Grannie, &ldquo;pity she was ever put out of it, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe so,&mdash;maybe no,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;Necessary anyway; one scabby
      sheep infects the flock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And has marriage daubed grace on the poor sheep's sore then, Cæsar?&rdquo; said
      Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's Mistress Robbie Teare and a dacent woman, sir,&rdquo; said Cæsar, digging
      into the beef, &ldquo;and that's all the truck a Christian church has got with
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate did not eat her dinner that day, and neither did she speak out as she
      had intended. A supernatural power seemed to have come down at the last
      moment and barred up the one remaining pathway of escape. She was in the
      track of the storm. The tempest was ready to fall on her. Where could she
      fly for shelter?
    </p>
    <p>
      What her father had said of the girl had revealed her life to her in the
      light of her relation to Philip. The thought of the possible contingency
      which she had foreseen with so much joy, as so much power, had awakened
      the consciousness of her moral position. She was a fallen woman! What else
      was she? And if the contingency befell, what would become of her? In the
      intensity of her father's pietistic views the very shadow of shame would
      overwhelm his household, overthrow his sect, and uproot his religious
      pretensions. Kate trembled at the possibility of such a disaster coming
      through her. She saw herself being driven from house and home. Where could
      she fly? And though she fled away, would she not still be the cause of
      sorrow and disgrace to all whom she left behind&mdash;her mother, her
      father, Pete, everybody?
    </p>
    <p>
      If she could only tear out the past, at least she could stop this
      marriage. Or if she had been a man she could stop it, for a man may sin
      and still look to the future with a firm face. But she was a woman, and a
      woman's acts may be her own, but their consequences are beyond her. Oh,
      the misery of being a woman! She asked herself what she could do, and
      there was no answer. She could not break the web of circumstances. Her
      situation might be false, it might be dishonourable, but there was no
      escape from it. There was no gleam of hope anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late that night&mdash;Sunday night&mdash;they were sitting together in the
      kitchen, Kate in the fire-seat as usual, Pete on the stool by the turf
      closet, smoking up the chimney, Cæsar reading aloud, Grannie listening,
      and Nancy cooking the supper, when the porch door burst open and somebody
      entered. Kate rose to her feet with a startled cry of joy, looked round
      eagerly, and then sat down again covered with confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the girl Christian Killip, a pale, weak, frightened creature, with
      the mouth and eyes of a hare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Quilliam here?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's the man himself, Christian,&rdquo; said Grannie. &ldquo;What do you want with
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God bless you, sir,&rdquo; said the girl to Pete, &ldquo;God bless you for ever
      and ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then turning back to Grannie, she explained in woman's fashion, with many
      words, that somebody unknown had sent her twenty pounds, for the child, by
      post, the day before, and she had only now guessed who it must be when
      John the Clerk had told her what Pete had said a week before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete grunted and glimed, smoked up the chimney, and said, &ldquo;That'll do,
      ma'am, that'll do. Don't believe all you hear. John says more than his
      Amens, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm axing your pardon, miss,&rdquo; said the girl to Kate, &ldquo;but I couldn't help
      coming&mdash;I couldn't really&mdash;no, I couldn't,&rdquo; and then she began
      to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's that child?&rdquo; said Pete, heaving up to his feet with a ferocious
      look. &ldquo;What! you mane to say you've left the lil thing alone, asleep? Go
      back to it then immajent. Good night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, sir, and God bless you, and when you're married to-morrow,
      God bless your wife as well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll do&mdash;that'll do,&rdquo; said Pete, backing her to the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You desarve a good woman, sir, and may the Lord be good to you both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut! tut!&rdquo; said Pete, and he tut-tutted her out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smoothed her baby's hair more tenderly than ever that night, and
      kissed it again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate could scarcely breathe, she could barely see. Her pride and her will
      had broken down utterly. This greathearted man loved her. He would lay
      down his life if need be to save her. To morrow he would marry her. Here,
      then, was her rock of refuge&mdash;this strong man by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could struggle against fate no longer. It's invisible hand was pushing
      her on. It's blind power was dragging her. If Philip would not come to
      claim her she must marry Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Pete? She meant no harm to Pete. She had not yet thought of things
      from Pete's point of view. He was like the camel-bag in the desert to the
      terrified wayfarer when the sand-cloud breaks oyer him. He flies to it. It
      shelters him. But what of the camel itself, with its head in the storm?
      Until the storm is over he does not think of that.

    <h2>
      XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meantime Philip himself was in the throes of his own agony. At the news of
      Kate's illness he was overwhelmed with remorse, and when he inquired if
      she had been delirious, he was oppressed with a sense of meanness never
      felt before. At his meeting with Pete he realised for the first time to
      what depths his duplicity had degraded him. He had prided himself on being
      a man of honour, and he was suddenly thrown out of the paths in which he
      could walk honourably.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the first shock of Kate's disaster was over, he remembered the
      interview with the Governor. The Deemstership burnt in his mind with a
      growing fever of desire, but he did not apply for it. He did not even
      mention it to Auntie Nan. She heard of his prospects from Peter Christian
      Balla-whaine, who first set foot in her house on this errand of
      congratulation. The sweet old soul was wildly excited. All the hopes of
      her life were about to be realised, the visions and the dreams were coming
      true. Philip was going to regain what his father had lost. Had he made his
      application yet? No? He would, though; it was his duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Philip could not apply for the Deemstership. To sit down in cold blood
      and write to the Home Secretary while Kate was lying sick in bed would be
      too much like asking the devil's wages for sacrificing her. Then came Pete
      with his talk of the wedding. That did not really alarm him. It was only
      the last revolution of the old wheel that had been set spinning before
      Pete went away. Kate would not consent. They had taken her consent for
      granted. He felt easy, calm, and secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next came his old master, the college friend of his father, now promoted
      to the position of Clerk of the Polls. He was proud of his pupil, and had
      learnt that Philip was first favourite with the Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always knew it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I did, ma'am, I did. The first time I set
      eyes on him, thinks I, 'Here comes the makings of the best lawyer in the
      island,' and by &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; he's not going to disappoint me
      either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good fellow was a noisy, hearty, robustious creature, a bachelor, and
      when talking of the late Deemster, he said women were usually the chief
      obstacles in a man's career. Then he begged Auntie Nan's pardon, but the
      old lady showed no anger. She agreed that it had been so in some cases.
      Young men should be careful what stumbling-blocks they set up in the way
      of their own progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip listened in silence, and was conscious, through all the unselfish
      counselling, of a certain cynical bitterness. Still he did not make
      application for the Deemstership. Then came Cæsar's letter announcing the
      marriage, and even fixing a date for it. This threw him into a fit of
      towering indignation. He was certain of undue pressure. They were forcing
      the girl. It was his duty to stop the marriage. But how? There was one
      clear course, but that course he could not take. He could not go back on
      his settled determination that he must not, should not marry the girl
      himself. Only one thing was left&mdash;to rely on Kate. She would never
      consent. Not being able to marry <i>him</i>, she would marry no man. She
      would do as he was doing&mdash;she would suffer and stand alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Philip's love, which, in spite of himself, had grown cool
      since the Melliah, and in his fierce battle with his worldly aims,
      suddenly awakened to fresh violence at the approach of another man. But
      his ambition fought with his love, and he began to ask himself if it made,
      any difference after all in this matter of Kate whether he took the
      Deemstership or left it. Kate was recovering; he had nothing to reproach
      himself with, and it would be folly to sacrifice the ambition of a
      lifetime to the love of a woman who could never be his, a woman he could
      never marry. At that he wrote his letter to the Home Secretary. It was a
      brilliant letter of its kind, simple, natural, strong, and judicious. He
      had a calm assurance that nothing so good would leave the island, yet he
      could not bring himself to post it. Some quiverings of the old tenderness
      came back as he held it in his hand, some visions of Kate, with her
      twitching lips, her passionate eyes, some whisperings of their smothered
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came Pete again with the decisive blow. Kate <i>had</i> consented.
      There was no longer any room for doubt. His former indignation seemed
      almost comic, his confidence absurd. Kate was willing to marry Pete, and
      after all, what right had he to blame her? What right had he to stop the
      marriage? He had wronged the girl enough already. A good man came and
      offered her his love. She was going to take it. How should he dare to stop
      her from marrying another, being unable to marry her himself?
    </p>
    <p>
      That night he posted his letter to the Home Secretary, and calmed the
      gnawings of his love with dreams of ambition. He would regain the place of
      his father; he would revive the traditions of his grandfather; the
      Christians should resume their ancient standing in the Isle of Man; the
      last of their race should be a strong man and a just one. No, he would
      never marry; he would live alone, a quiet life, a peaceful one, slightly
      tinged with melancholy, yet not altogether unhappy, not without cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under all other emotions, strengthening and supporting him, was a secret
      bitterness towards Kate&mdash;a certain contempt of her fickleness, her
      lightness, her shallow love, her readiness to be off with the old love and
      on with the new. There was a sort of pride in his own higher type of
      devotion, his sterner passion. Pete invited him to the wedding, but he
      would not go, he would invent some excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the change of the day to suit his supposed convenience, and also
      Kate's own invitation. Very well, be it so. Kate was defying him. Her
      invitation was a challenge. He would take it; he would go to the wedding.
      And if their eyes should meet, he knew whose eyes must fall.

    <h2>
      XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Early next day the sleeping morning was awakened by the sound of a horn.
      It began somewhere in the village, wandered down the glen, crossed the
      bridge, plodded over the fields, and finally coiled round the house of the
      bride in thickening groans of discord. This restless spirit in the grey
      light was meant as herald of the approaching wedding. It came from the
      husky lungs of Mr. Jonaique Jelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before daylight &ldquo;The Manx Fairy&rdquo; was already astir. Somewhere in the early
      reaches of the dawn the house had its last dusting down at the hands of
      Nancy Joe. Then Grannie finished, on hearth and griddle, the baking of her
      cakes. After that, some of the neighbours came and carried off to their
      own fires the beef, mutton, chickens, and ducks intended for the day's
      dinner. It was woman's work that was to the fore, and all idle men were
      hustled out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards nine o'clock breakfast was swallowed standing. Then everybody
      began to think of dressing. In this matter the men had to be finished off
      before the women could begin. Already they were heard bellowing for help
      from unseen regions upstairs. Grannie took Cæsar in hand. Pete was in
      charge of Nancy Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was found at the last moment that Pete had forgotten to provide himself
      with a white shirt. He had nothing to be married in except the flannel one
      in which he came home from Africa. This would never do. It wasn't proper,
      it wasn't respectable. There was no choice but to borrow a shirt of
      Cæsar's. Cæsar's shirt was of ancient pattern, and Pete was shy of taking
      it. &ldquo;Take it, or you'll have none,&rdquo; said Nancy, and she pushed him back
      into his room. When he emerged from it he walked with a stiff neck down
      the stairs in a collar that reached to his ears at either side, and stood
      out at his cheeks like the wings of a white bat, with two long sharp
      points on the level of his eyes, which he seemed to be watching warily to
      avoid the stab of their ironed starch. At the same moment Cæsar appeared
      in duck trousers, a flowered waistcoat, a swallow-tail coat, and a tall
      hat of rough black beaver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kitchen was full of men and women by this time, and groups of young
      fellows were gathered on the road outside, some with horses, saddled and
      bridled for the bride's race home after the ceremony; others with guns
      ready loaded for firing as the procession appeared; and others again with
      lines of print handkerchiefs, which, as substitutes for flags, they were
      hanging from tree to tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      At every moment the crowd became greater outside, and the company inside
      more dense. John the Clerk called on his way to church, and whispered Pete
      that everything was ready, and they were going to sing a beautiful psalm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't many a man's wedding I would be taking the same trouble with,&rdquo;
       said John. &ldquo;When you are coming down the alley give a sight up, sir, and
      you'll see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's only a poor thing,&rdquo; said Mr. Jelly in Pete's ear as John the Clerk
      went off. &ldquo;No more music in the man than my ould sow. Did you hear the
      horn this morning, sir? Never got up so early for a wedding before. I'll
      be giving you 'the Black and the Grey' going into the church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grannie came down in a gigantic bonnet like a half-moon, with her white
      cap visible beneath it; and Nancy Joe appeared behind her, be-ribboned out
      of all recognition, and taller by many inches for the turret of feathers
      and flowers on the head that was usually bare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the church bells began to peal, and Cæsar made a prolonged A&mdash;hm!
      and said in a large way, &ldquo;Has the carriage arrived?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's coming over by the bridge now,&rdquo; said somebody at the door, and at
      the next moment a covered wagonette drew up at the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All ready?&rdquo; asked Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, sir,&rdquo; said Pete, and then, turning to Nancy Joe, &ldquo;Is it glad a man
      should be on his wedding-day, Nancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of coorse, you goose. What else?&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no man can be glad in a shirt like this,&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;I'm going
      back to take it off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two minutes afterwards he reappeared in his flannel one, under his suit of
      blue pilot, looking simple and natural, and a man every inch of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now call the bride,&rdquo; said Cæsar.

    <h2>
      XXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kate had been kept awake during the dark hours with a sound in her ears
      that was like the measured ringing of far-off bells. When the daylight
      came she slept a troubled sleep, and when she awoke she had a sense of
      stupefaction, as if she had taken a drug, and was not yet recovered from
      the effects of it. Nancy came bouncing into her room and crying, &ldquo;It's
      your wedding-day, Kitty!&rdquo; She answered by repeating mechanically, &ldquo;It's
      your wedding day, Kitty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an expression of serenity on her face; she even smiled a little.
      A sort of vague gaiety came over her, such as comes to one who has watched
      long in agony and suspense by the bed of a sick person and the person is
      dead. Nancy drew the little window curtain aside, stooped down, and looked
      out and said, &ldquo;'Happy the bride the sun shines on' they're saying, and
      look! the sun is shining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but the sun is an old sly-boots,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came up to dress her. She kept stumbling against things, and then
      laughing in a faint way. The dress was the new one, and when they had put
      it on they stood back from her and shouted with delight. She took up the
      little broken hand-glass to look at herself. Her great eyes sparkled
      piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church bells began to ring her wedding-peal. She had to listen hard to
      hear it. All sounds seemed to be very far away; everything looked a long
      way off. She was living in a sort of dead white dawn of thought and
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they came to say the coach was ready and everything was waiting
      for the bride. She repeated their message like a machine, made a slow
      gesture, and followed them downstairs. When she got near to the bottom,
      she looked around on the faces below as if expecting to see somebody. Just
      then her father was saying, &ldquo;Mr. Christian is to meet us at the church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled faintly and answered the people's greetings in an indistinct
      tone. There was some indulgent whispering at sight of her pale face. &ldquo;Pale
      but genteel,&rdquo; said some one, and then Nancy reached over and drew the
      bride's veil down over her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the next minute she was outside the house, standing at the back of the
      wagonette. The coachman, with his white rosette, was holding the door open
      on one side, and her father was elevating her hand on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to go, then?&rdquo; she asked in a helpless voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do <i>you</i> think?&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;Shall the man slip off and
      get married to himself, think you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was laughter among the people standing round, and she laughed also
      and stepped into the coach. Her mother followed her, crinkling in noisy
      old silk, and Nancy Joe came next, smelling of lavender and hair-oil. Then
      her father got in, and then Pete, with his great warm presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A salute of six guns was fired straight up by the coach-windows. The
      horses pranced, Nancy screamed, and Grannie started, but Kate gave no
      sign. People were closing round the coach-door and shouting altogether as
      at a fair. &ldquo;Good luck to you, boy. Good luck! Good luck!&rdquo; Pete was
      answering in a rolling voice that seemed to be lifting the low roof off,
      and at the same time flinging money out in handfuls as the horses moved
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were going slowly down the road. From somewhere in front came the
      sound of a clarionet. It was playing &ldquo;the Black and the Grey.&rdquo; Immediately
      behind there was the tramp of people walking with an even step, and on
      either side the rustle of an irregular crowd. The morning was warm and
      beautiful. Here and there the last of the golden cushag glistened on the
      hedges with the first of the autumn gorse. They passed two or three houses
      that had been made roofless by the recent storm, and once or twice they
      came on a fallen tree-trunk with its thin leaves yellowing on the fading
      grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate was floating vaguely through these sights and sounds. It was all like
      a dream to her&mdash;a waking dream in shadow-land. She knew where she was
      and where she was going. Some glimmering of hope was left yet. She was
      half expecting a miracle of some sort. Philip would be at the church.
      Something supernatural would occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drew up sharply, the glass of the windows rattled, and the talk that
      had been going on in the carriage ceased. &ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; cried Cæsar;
      there were voices outside, and then the others inside stepped down. She
      saw a hand held out to her and knew whose it was before her eyes had risen
      to the face. Philip was there. He was helping her to alight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to get down too?&rdquo; she asked in a helpless way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar said something that made the people laugh again, and then she smiled
      like faded sunshine and took the hand of Philip. She held it a moment as
      if expecting him to say something, but he only raised his hat. His face
      was white as marble. He will speak yet, she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the gateway to the churchyard there was an arch of flowers and
      evergreens, with an inscription in coloured letters: &ldquo;God bless the happy
      pair.&rdquo; The sloping path going down as to a dell was strewn with gilvers
      and slips of fuchsia.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the bottom stood the old church mantled in ivy, like a rock of the sea
      covered by green moss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning on her father's arm she walked in at the porch. The church was
      full of people. As they passed under the gallery there was a twittering as
      of birds. The Sunday-school girls were up there, looking down and talking
      eagerly. Then the coughing and hemming ceased; there was a sort of deep
      inspiration; the church seemed to hold its breath for a moment. After that
      there were broken exclamations, and the coughing and hemming began again.
      &ldquo;How pale!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Not fit, poor thing.&rdquo; Everybody was pitying her starved
      features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand here,&rdquo; said somebody in a soft voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I?&rdquo; she said quite loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once she was aware that she was alone before the communion rail,
      with the parson&mdash;old ruddy-faced Parson Quiggin&mdash;in his white
      surplice facing her. Some one came and stood beside her. It was Pete. She
      did not look at him, but she felt his warm presence again, and was
      relieved. It was like shelter from the eyes around. After a moment she
      turned about Philip was one step behind Pete. His head was bent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the service began. The voice of the parson muttered words in a low
      voice, but she did not listen. She found herself trying to spell out the
      Manx text printed over the chancel arch: &ldquo;Bannet T'eshyn Ta Cheet ayns
      Ennyn y Chearn&rdquo; (&ldquo;Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord&rdquo;).
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the words the parson was speaking leapt into meaning and made her
      quiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;.... is commended of Saint Paul to be honourable among all men, and
      therefore not by any to be enterprised, nor taken in hand unadvisedly,
      lightly, or wantonly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to know that Philip's eyes were on her. They were on the back
      of her head, and the veil over her face began to shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of the parson was going on again&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore if any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be
      joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter for ever hold his
      peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned half around. Her eyes fell on Philip. His face was colourless,
      almost fierce; his forehead was deathly white. She was sure that something
      was about to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now was the moment for the miracle. It seemed to her as if the whole
      congregation were beginning to divine what tie there was between him and
      her. She did not care, for he would soon declare it. He was going to do so
      now; he had raised his head, he was about to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, there was no miracle. Philip's eyes fell before her eyes, and his head
      went down. He was only digging at the red baize with one of his feet. She
      felt tired, so very tired, and oh! so cold. The parson had gone on with
      his reading. When she caught up with him he was saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;as ye shall, answer at the great day of judgment, when the secrets
      of all hearts shall be disclosed, that if either of you know any
      impediment why ye may not be lawfully joined together in matrimony, ye do
      now confess it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The parson paused. He had always paused at that point. The pause had no
      meaning for him, but for Kate how much! Impediment! There was indeed an
      impediment. Confess? How could she ever confess? The warning terrified
      her. It seemed to have been made for her alone. She had heard it before,
      and thought nothing of it. Now it seemed to scorch her very soul. She
      began to tremble violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an indistinct murmur which she did not catch. The parson seemed
      to be speaking to Pete&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;love her, comfort her, honour and keep her... so long as ye both
      shall live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then came Pete's voice, full and strong from his great chest, but far
      off, and going by her ear like a voice in a shell&mdash;&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that the parson's words seemed to be falling on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilt thou have this man to thy wedded husband, to live together after
      God's ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony? Wilt thou obey him and
      serve him, love, honour, and keep him in sickness and in health; and
      forsaking all other, keep thee unto him, so long as ye both shall live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate was far away. She was spelling out the Manx text, &ldquo;Bannet T'eshyn Ta
      Cheet,&rdquo; but the letters were dancing in and out of each other, and yellow
      lights were darting from her eyes. Suddenly she was aware that the
      parson's voice had stopped. There was blank silence, then an uneasy
      rustle, and then somebody was saying something in a soft tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; she said aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson's voice came now in a whisper at her breast&mdash;&ldquo;Say, 'I
      will.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah I,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I-will! That's all, my dear. Say it with me, 'I&mdash;will.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She framed her lips to speak, but the words were half uttered by the
      parson. The next thing she knew was that a stray hand was holding her
      hand. She felt more safe now that her poor cold fingers lay in that big
      warm palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Pete, and he was speaking again. She did not so much hear him as
      feel his voice tingling through her veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, Peter Quilliam, take thee, Katherine Cregeen&mdash;&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was all a vague murmur, fraying off into nothing, ending like a
      wave with a long upward plash of low sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson was speaking to her again, softly, gently, caressingly, almost
      as if she were a frightened child. &ldquo;Don't be afraid, my dear! try to speak
      after me. Take your time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, aloud, &ldquo;'I, Katherine Cregeen.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her throat gurgled; she faltered, but she spoke at length in the toneless
      voice of one who speaks in sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I, Katherine Cregeen&mdash;-'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Take thee, Peter Quilliam&mdash;&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The toneless voice broke&mdash;&mdash; &ldquo;take thee, Peter Quilliam&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then all came in a rush, with some of the words distinctly repeated,
      and some of them droned and dropped&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;'to my wedded husband, to have and to hold&mdash;&mdash;-'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;'have and to hold&mdash;&mdash;-'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;'from this day forward.... till death do us part&mdash;&mdash;-'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;'death do us part&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;'therefore I give thee my troth&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;'troth&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last word fell like a broken echo, and then there was a rustle in the
      church, and much audible breathing. Some of the school-girls in the
      gallery were reaching over the pews with parted lips and dancing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete had taken her left hand, and was putting the ring on her finger. She
      was conscious of his warm breath and of the words&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With this ring I thee wed, with my body I thee worship, and with all my
      worldly goods I thee endow, Amen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she left her cold hand in Pete's warm hand. He was stroking it on
      the outside with his other one.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all a dream. She seemed to rally from it as she moved down the
      aisle. Ghostly faces were smiling at her out of the air on either side,
      and the choir in the gallery behind the school-girls were singing the
      psalm, with John the Clerk's husky voice drawling out the first word of
      each new verse as his companions were singing the last word of the
      preceding one&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine upon the walls of thine house;
  Thy children like the olive branches round about thy table.
  As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be;
  World without end, A&mdash;men.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      They were all in the vestry now, standing together in a group. Her mother
      was wiping her eyes, Pete was laughing, and Nancy Joe was nudging him and
      saying in an audible whisper, &ldquo;Kiss her, man&mdash;it's only respectable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The parson was leaning over the table. He spoke to Pete, and then said, &ldquo;A
      substantial mark, too. The lady's turn next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The open book was before her, and the pen was put into her hand. When she
      laid it down, the parson returned his spectacles to their sheath, and a
      nervous voice, which thrilled and frightened her, said from behind, &ldquo;Let
      me be the first to wish you happiness, Mrs. Quilliam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Philip. She turned towards him, and their eyes met for a moment.
      But she was only conscious of his prominent nose, his clear-cut chin, his
      rapid smile like sunshine, disappearing as before a cloud. He said
      something else&mdash;something about a new life and a new beginning&mdash;but
      she could not gather its meaning, her mind would not take it in. At the
      next moment they were all in the open air.

    <h2>
      XXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Philip had been in torment&mdash;first the torment of an irresistible
      hatred of Kate. He knew that this hatred was illogical, that it was
      monstrous; but it supported his pride, it held him safe above
      self-contempt in being present at the wedding. When the carriage drew up
      at the church gate, and he helped Kate to alight, he thought she looked up
      at him as one who says, &ldquo;You see, things are not so bad after all!&rdquo; And
      when she turned her face to him at the beginning of the service, he
      thought it wore a look of fierce triumph, of victory, of disdain. But as
      the ceremony proceeded and he observed her absent-ness, her vacancy, her
      pathetic imbecility, he began to be oppressed by an awful sense of her
      consciousness of error. Was she taking this step out of pique? Was she
      thinking to punish him, forgetting the price she would have to pay? Would
      she awake to-morrow morning with her vexation and vanity gone, face to
      face with a hideous future&mdash;the worst and most terrible that is
      possible to any woman&mdash;that of being married to one man and loving
      another?
    </p>
    <p>
      Faugh! Would his own vanity haunt him even there? Shame, shame! He forced
      himself to do the duty of a best man. In the vestry he approached the
      bride and muttered the conventional wishes. His heart was devouring itself
      like a rapid fire, and it was as much as he could do to look into her
      piteous eyes and speak. Struggle as he might at that moment, he could not
      put out of his heart a passionate tenderness. This frightened him, and
      straightway he resolved to see no more of Kate. He must be fair to her, he
      must be true to himself. But walking behind her up the path strewn with
      flowers from the church door to the gate, the gnawings of the worm of
      buried love came on him again, and he felt like a man who was being
      dragged through the dirt.

      Four saddle-horses, each with its rider seated and ready, had been waiting
      at the churchyard gate, pawing up the gravel. The instant the bride and
      bridegroom came out of the church the horses set off for Cæsar's house at
      a furious gallop. Kate and Pete, Cæsar, Grannie, and Nancy, with the
      addition of Philip and Parson Quiggin, returned in the covered carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the turn of the road the way was blocked by a group of stalwart girls
      out of the last of the year's cornfields. With the straw rope of the
      stackyard stretched across, they demanded toll before the carriage would
      be allowed to pass. Pete, who sat by the door, put his head out and
      inquired solemnly if the highway women would take their charge in silver
      or in kind&mdash;half-a-crown apiece or a kiss all round. They laughed,
      and answered that they saw no objection to taking both. Whereupon Pete,
      whispering behind his hand that the mistress was looking, tossed into the
      air a paper bag, which rose like a cannon-ball, broke in the air like a
      shell, and fell over their white sun-bonnets like a shower.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door of &ldquo;The Manx Fairy&rdquo; the four riders were waiting with smoking
      horses. The first to arrive had been rewarded already with a bottle of
      rum. He had one other ancient privilege. As the coach drove up to the
      door, he stepped up to the bride with the wedding-cake and broke it over
      her head. Then there was a scramble for the pieces among the girls who
      gathered round her, that they might take them to bed and dream of a day to
      come when they should themselves be as proud and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding-breakfast (a wedding-dinner) was laid in the loft of the mill,
      the chapel of The Christians. Cæsar sat at the head of the table, with
      Grannie on one side and Kate on the other. Pete sat next to Kate, and
      Philip next to Grannie. The parson sat at the foot with Nancy Joe, a lady
      of consequence, receiving much consideration, at his reverent right hand.
      Jonaique Jelly sat midway down the table, with a fine scorn on his
      features, for John the Clerk sat opposite with a fiddle gripped between
      his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neighbours brought in the joints of beef and mutton, the chickens and
      the ducks. Cæsar and the parson carved. Black Tom, who had been invited by
      way of truce, served out the liquor from an eighteen-gallon cask, and
      sucked it up himself like the sole of an old shoe. Then Cæsar said grace,
      and the company fell to. Such noise, such sport, such chaff, such
      laughter! Everything was a jest&mdash;every word had wit in it. &ldquo;How are
      you doing, John?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Haven't done as well for a month, sir; but what's
      it saying, two hungry meals make the third a glutton.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;How are <i>you</i>
      doing, Tom?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No time to get a right mouthful for myself Cæsar; kept
      so busy with the drink.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Aw, there'll be some with their top works
      hampered soon.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Got plenty, Jonaique?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Plenty, sir, plenty.
      Enough down here to victual a menagerie. It'll be Sunday every day of the
      week with the man that's getting the lavings.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Take a taste of this
      beef before it goes, Mr. Thomas Quilliam, or do you prefer the mutton?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I'm
      not partic'lar, Mr. Cregeen. Ateing's nothing to me but filling a sack
      that's empty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grannie praised the wedding service&mdash;it was lovely&mdash;it was
      beautiful&mdash;she didn't think the ould parzon could have made the like;
      but Cæsar criticised both church and clergy&mdash;couldn't see what for
      the cross on the pulpit and the petticoat on the parson. &ldquo;Popery, sir,
      clane Popery,&rdquo; he whispered across Grannie to Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away went the shanks of mutton, the breasts of birds, and the slabs of
      beef, and up came an apple-pudding as round as a well-fed salmon, and as
      long as a twenty-pound cod. There was a shout of welcome. &ldquo;None of your
      dynamite pudding that,&mdash;as green as grass and as sour as vinegar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate was called on to make the first cut of the monster. A faint colour
      had returned to her cheeks since she had come home. She was talking a
      little, and even laughing sometimes, as if the weight on her heart was
      lightening every moment. She rose at the call, took, with the hand nearest
      to the dish, the knife that her father held out, and plunged it into the
      pudding. As she did so, with all eyes upon her, the wedding-ring on her
      finger flashed in the light and was seen by everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that, though,&rdquo; cried Black Tom. &ldquo;There's the wife for a husband,
      if you plaze. Ashamed of showing it, is she? Not she, the bogh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there was much giggling among the younger women, and cries of &ldquo;Aw,
      the poor girl! Going to church has been making her left-handed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time enough, my beauties,&rdquo; cried Pete; &ldquo;and mind you're not struck that
      way yourselves one of these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Away went the dishes, and the parson rose to return thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard that grace but once before, Parson Quiggin,&rdquo; said Pete, &ldquo;and
      then&rdquo;&mdash;lighting his pipe&mdash;&ldquo;then it was a burial sarvice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A <i>burial</i> sarvice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dozen voices echoed the words together, and in a moment the table was
      quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, though,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;It was up at Johannesburg. Two chums settled
      there, and one married a girl. Nice lil thing, too; some of the Boer
      girls, you know; but not much ballast at her at all. The husband went up
      country for the Consolidated Co., and when he came back there was trouble.
      Chum had been sweethearting the wife a bit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, dear!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Aw, well, well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do? The husband? He went after the chum with a repeater, and took him.
      Bath-chair sort of a chap&mdash;no fight in him at all. 'Mercy!' he cries.
      'I can't,' says the husband. 'Forgive him this once,' says the wife. 'It's
      only once a woman loses herself,' says the man. 'Mercy, mercy!' 'Say your
      prayers.' 'Mercy, mercy, mercy!' 'Too late!' and the husband shot him
      dead. The woman dropped in a faint, but the man said, 'He didn't say his
      prayers, though&mdash;I must be doing it for him.' Then down he went on
      his knees by the body, but the prayers were all forgot at him&mdash;all
      but the bit of a grace, so he said that instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loud breathings on every side followed Pete's story, and Cæsar, leaning
      over towards Philip, whose face had grown ashy, said, &ldquo;Terrible, sir,
      terrible! But still and for all, right enough, though, eh! What's it
      saying, Better an enemy than a bad friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip answered absently; his eyes were on the opposite side of the table.
      There was a sudden rising of the people about Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water, there,&rdquo; shouted Pete. &ldquo;It's a thundering blockhead I am for sure&mdash;frightning
      the life out of people with stories fit for a funeral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Kate; &ldquo;I'm not faint Why should you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of coorse, not, bogh,&rdquo; said Nancy, who was behind her in a twinkling.
      &ldquo;White is she? Well, what of it, man? It's only becoming on a girl's
      wedding-day. Take a lil sup, though, woman&mdash;there, there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate drank the water, with the glass jingling against her teeth, and then
      began to laugh. The parson's ruddy face rose at the end of the table.
      &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;after that tragic story, let us indulge in a little
      vanity. Fill up your glasses to the brim, and drink with me to the health
      of the happy couple. We all know both of them. We know the bride for a
      good daughter and a sweet girl&mdash;one so naturally pure that nobody can
      ever say an evil word or think an evil thought when she is near. We know
      the bridegroom for a real Manxman, simple and rugged and true, who says
      all he thinks and thinks all he says. God has been very good to them. Such
      virginal and transparent souls have much to be thankful for. It is not for
      them to struggle with that worst enemy of man, the enemy that is within,
      the enemy of bad passions. So we can wish them joy on their union with a
      full heart and a sure hope that, whatever chance befall them on the ways
      of this world, they will be happy and content.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, the beautiful advice,&rdquo; said Grannie, wiping her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Popery, just Popery,&rdquo; muttered Cæsar. &ldquo;What about original sin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a chorus of applause. Kate was still laughing. Philip's head was
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, friends,&rdquo; continued the parson, &ldquo;Captain Quilliam has been a
      successful man abroad, but he has had to come home to do the best piece of
      work he ever did.&rdquo; (A voice&mdash;&ldquo;Do it yourself, parzon.&rdquo;) &ldquo;It is true
      I've never done it myself. Vanity of vanities, love is not for me. It's
      been the Lord's will to put me here to do the marrying and leave my people
      to do the loving. But there is a young man present who has all the world
      before him and everything this life can promise except one thing, and
      that's the best thing of all&mdash;a wife.&rdquo; (Kate's laughter grew
      boisterous.) &ldquo;This morning he helped his friend to marry a pure and
      beautiful maiden. Now let me remind him of the text which says, 'Go thou
      and do likewise.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The toast was drunk standing, with shouts of &ldquo;Cap'n Pete,&rdquo; and, amid much
      hammering on the table, stamping on the floor, and other thunderings of
      applause, Cap'n Pete rolled up to reply. After a moment's pause, in which
      he distributed sage winks and nods on every side, he said: &ldquo;I'm not much
      for public spaking myself. I made my best speech and my shortest in church
      this morning&mdash;<i>I will</i>. The parzon has has been telling my <i>dooiney
      molla</i> to do as I have done today. He can't. Begging pardon of the
      ladies, there's only one woman on the island fit for him, and I've got
      her.&rdquo; (Kate's laughter grew shrill.) &ldquo;My wife&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this word, uttered with an air of life-long familiarity, twenty clay
      pipes lost their heads by collision with the table, and Pete was
      interrupted by roars of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gough bless me, can't a married man mention his wife in company? Well
      then. Mistress Cap'n Peter Quilliam&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This mouthful was the signal for another riotous interruption, and a
      general call for more to drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't that do for you neither? I'm not going back on it, though. 'Whom
      God hath joined together let no man put asunder'&mdash;isn't that it,
      Parzon Quiggin? What's it you're saying&mdash;no man but the Dempster?
      Well, the Dempster's here that is to be&mdash;I'll clear him of <i>that</i>,
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate's laughter became explosive and uncontrollable. Pete nodded sideways
      to fill up the gap in his eloquence, and then went on. &ldquo;But if my <i>dooiney
      molla</i> can't marry my wife, there's one thing he can do for her&mdash;he
      can make her house his home in Ramsey when he goes to Douglas for good and
      comes down here to the coorts once a fortnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate laughed more immoderately than ever; but Philip, with a look of
      alarm, half rose from his seat, and said across the table, &ldquo;There's my
      aunt at Ballure, Pete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll be following after you,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are hotels enough for travellers,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too many by half, and that's why I asked in public,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the brotherly feeling&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a promise?&rdquo; demanded Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can't escape your kindness&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you can't; so there's an end of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will kill me yet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May you never die till it polishes you off.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Philip's submission to Pete's will, there was a general chorus of
      cheers, through which Kate's shrill laughter rang like a scream. Pete
      patted the back of her hand, and continued, &ldquo;And now, young fellows there,
      let an ould experienced married man give you a bit of advice&mdash;he
      swore away all his worldly goods this morning, so he hasn't much else to
      give. I've no belief in bachelors myself. They're like a tub without a
      handle&mdash;nothing to lay hould of them by.&rdquo; (Much nudging and
      whispering about the bottom of the table.) &ldquo;What's that down yonder? 'The
      vicar,' you say? Aw, the vicar's a grand man, but he's only a parzon, you
      see. Mr. Christian, is it? He's got too much work to do to be thinking
      about women. We're living on the nineteenth century, boys, and it's
      middling hard feeding for some of us. If the fishing's going to the dogs
      and the farming going to the deuce, don't be tossing head over tip at the
      tail of the tourist. If you've got the pumping engine inside of you, in
      plain English, if you've got the indomable character of the rael Manxman,
      do as I done&mdash;go foreign. Then watch your opportunity. What's
      Shake-spar saying?&rdquo; Pete paused. &ldquo;What's that he's saying, now?&rdquo; Pete
      scratched his forehead. &ldquo;Something about a flood, anyway.&rdquo; Pete stretched
      his hand out vigorously. &ldquo;'Lay hould of it at the flood,' says he, 'that's
      the way to make your fortune.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Pete melted to sentiment, glanced down at Kate's head, and continued,
      &ldquo;And when you come back to the ould island&mdash;and there isn't no place
      like it&mdash;you can marry the girl of your heart, God bless her. Work's
      black, but money's white, and love is as sweet on potatoes and herrings
      three times a day, as on nothing for dinner, and the same every night of
      the week for supper. While you're away, you'll be draming of her. 'Is she
      faithful?' 'Is she thrue?' Coorse she is, and waiting to take you the very
      minute you come home.&rdquo; Kate was still laughing as if she could not stop.
      &ldquo;Look out for the right sort, boys. Plenty of the like in yet. If the
      young men of these days are more smart and more educated than their
      fathers, the young women are more handsome and more virtuous than their
      mothers. So <i>ben-my-chree</i>, my hearties, and enough in the locker to
      drive away the divil and the coroner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the volley of cheers which followed Pete's speech came the voice
      of Black Tom, thick with drink, &ldquo;Drive off the crow at the
      wedding-breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody rose and looked. A great crow, black as night, had come in at
      the open door of the mill, calmly, sedately, as if by habit, for the corn
      that usually lay there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It manes divorce,&rdquo; said Black Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scare it away,&rdquo; cried some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the new wife must do it,&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Kate?&rdquo; cried Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Kate only looked and went on laughing as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crow turned tail and took flight of itself at finding so eager an
      audience. Then Pete said, &ldquo;Whose houlding with such ould wife's wonders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Cæsar answered, &ldquo;Coorse not, or fairies either. I've slept out all
      night on Cronk-ny-airy-Lhaa&mdash;before my days of grace, I mane&mdash;and
      I never seen no fairies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a fool of a fairy, though, that would let <i>you</i> see him,
      Cæsar,&rdquo; said Black Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nine o'clock Cæsar's gig was at the door of &ldquo;The Manx Fairy&rdquo; to take
      the bride and bridegroom home. They had sung &ldquo;Mylecharane,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Keerie fu
      Snaighty,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hunting the Wren,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Win' that Shook the Barley,&rdquo;
       and then they had cleared away the tables and danced to the fiddle of John
      the Clerk and the clarionet of Jonaique Jelly. Kate, with wild eyes and
      flushed cheeks, had taken part in everything, but always fiercely,
      violently, almost tempestuously, until people lost enjoyment of her
      heartiness in fear of her hysteria, and Cæsar whispered Pete to take her
      away, and brought round the gig to hasten them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate went up for her cloak and hat, and in the interval between her
      departure and reappearance, Grannie and Nancy Joe, both glorified beings,
      Nancy with her unaccustomed cap askew, stood in the middle of a group of
      women, who were deferring, and inquiring, and sympathising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know in the world how she has kept up so long,&rdquo; said Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And dear heart knows how <i>I'm</i> to keep up when she's gone,&rdquo; said
      Nancy, with her apron to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate came down ready. Everybody followed her into the road, and all stood
      round the gig with flashes from the gig-lamps on their faces, while Pete
      swung her up into the seat, lifting her bodily in his great arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't drown yourself to-night for an ould rusty nail, eh, Capt'n?&rdquo;
       cried somebody with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go bail,&rdquo; said Pete, and he leapt up to Kate's side, twiddled the
      reins, cracked the whip, and they drove away.

    <h2>
      XXIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Philip had stood at the door of the porch, struggling to command his soul,
      and employing all his powers to look cheerful and even gay. But as Kate
      had passed she had looked at him with an imploring look, and then he had
      seemed to understand everything&mdash;that she had made a mistake and that
      she knew it, that her laughter had been bitterer than tears, that some
      compulsion had been put upon her, and that she was a wretched and
      miserable woman. At the next moment she had gone by with an odour of lace
      and perfume; and then a flood of tenderness, of pity, of mad jealousy had
      come upon him, and it had been as much as he could do to restrain himself.
      One instant he held himself in hand, and at the next the wheels of the gig
      had begun to move, the horse had started, the women had trooped into the
      house again, and there was nothing before him but the broad back of Cæsar,
      who was looking into the darkness after the vanishing gig-lamps, and
      breathing asthmatical breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave
      unto his wife,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;You're time enough yet, sir; come in, come
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the man was odious to Philip at that moment, the house was odious, the
      people and the talk inside were odious, and he slipped away unobserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too late! From the torment of his own thoughts he could not escape&mdash;his
      lost love, his lost happiness, his memories of the past, his dreams of the
      future. A voice&mdash;it was his own voice&mdash;seemed to be taunting him
      constantly: &ldquo;You were not worthy of her. You did not know her value. She
      is gone; and what have you got instead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Deemstership! That was of no consequence now. A name, an idle name!
      Love was the only thing worth having, and it was lost. Without it all the
      rest was nothing, and he had flung it away. He had been a monster, he had
      been a fool. The thought of his folly was insupportable; the recollection
      of his selfishness was stifling; the memory of his calculating
      deliberations was dragging him again in the dust. Thus, with a sense of
      crushing shame, he plunged down the dark road, trying not to think of the
      gig that had gone swinging along in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would leave the island. To-morrow he would sail for England. No matter
      if he lost the chance of promotion. To-morrow, to-morrow! But to-night?
      How could he live through the hours until morning, with the black thoughts
      which the darkness generated? How could he sleep? How lie awake? What drug
      would bring forgetfulness? Kate! Pete! To-night! Oh, God! oh, God!

    <h2>
      XXV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Six strides of the horse into the darkness and Kate's hysteria was gone.
      She had been lost to herself the whole day-through, and now she possessed
      herself again. She grew quiet and silent, and even solemn. But Pete
      rattled on with cheerful talk about the day's doings. At the doors of the
      houses on the road as they passed, people were standing in the half-light
      to wave them salutations, and Pete sent back his answers in shouts and
      laughter. Turning the bridge they saw a little group at the porch of the
      &ldquo;Ginger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's company waiting for us yonder,&rdquo; said Pete, giving the mare a
      touch of the whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us get on,&rdquo; said Kate in a nervous whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, let's be neighbourly, you know,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;It wouldn't be dacent to
      disappoint people at all. We'll hawl up for a minute just, and hoof up the
      time at a gallop. Woa, lass, woa, mare, woa, bogh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the gig drew up at the inn door, a voice out of the porch cried, &ldquo;Joy
      to you, Capt'n, and joy to your lady, and long life and prosperity to you
      both, and may the Lord give you children and health and happiness to rear
      them, and may you see your children's children, and may they call you
      blessed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glasses round. Mrs. Kelly,&rdquo; shouted Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, please,&rdquo; said Kate in a fretful whisper, and she tugged at Pete's
      sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stars came out; the moon gave a peep; the late hay of the Curragh sent
      a sweet odour through the night. Kate shuddered and Pete covered her
      shoulders with a rug. Then he began to sing snatches. He sang bits of all
      the songs that had been sung that night, but kept coming back at intervals
      to an old Manx ditty which begins&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Little red bird of the black turf ground,
          Where did you sleep last night?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Thus he sang like a great boy as he went rolling down the dark road, and
      Kate sat by his side and trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came to the town, rattled down the Parliament Street, passed the
      Court-house under the trees, turned the sharp angle by the market-place,
      and drew up at Elm Cottage in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home at last,&rdquo; cried Pete, and he leapt to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dog began to bark inside the house. &ldquo;D'ye hear him?&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;That's
      the master in charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The porch door was opened, and a comfortable-looking woman in a widow's
      cap came out with a lighted candle shaded by her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is your housekeeper, Mrs. Gorry,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate did not answer. Her eyes had been fixed in a rigid stare on the
      hind-quarters of the horse, which were steaming in the light of the lamps.
      Pete lifted her down as he had lifted her up. Then Mrs. Gorry took her by
      the hand, and saying, &ldquo;Mind the step, ma'am&mdash;this way, ma'am,&rdquo; led
      her through the gate and along the garden path, and up to the porch. The
      porch opened on a square hall, furnished as a sitting-room. A fire was
      burning, a lamp was lit, the table was laid for supper, and the place was
      warm and cosy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>There!</i> What d'ye say to <i>that</i>?&rdquo; cried Pete, coming behind
      with the whip in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate looked around; she did not speak; her eyes began to fill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it fit for a Dempster's lady?&rdquo; said Pete, sweeping the whip-handle
      round the room like a showman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate could bear no more. She sank into a chair and burst into a fit of
      tears. Pete's glowing face dropped in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear heart alive, darling, what is it?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My poor girl, what's
      troubling you at all? Tell me, now&mdash;tell me, bogh, tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's nothing, Pete, nothing. Don't ask me,&rdquo; said Kate. But still she
      sobbed as if her heart would break.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete stood a moment by her side, smoothing her arm with his hand. Then he
      said, with a crack and a quaver in his great voice, &ldquo;It <i>is</i> hard for
      a girl, I know that, to lave father and mother and every one and
      everything that's been sweet and dear to her since she was a child, and to
      come to the house of her husband and say, 'The past has been very good to
      me; but still and for all, I'm for trusting the future to you.' It's hard,
      darling; I know it's hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, leave me! leave me!&rdquo; cried Kate, still weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete brushed his sleeve across his eyes, and said, &ldquo;Take her upstairs,
      Mrs. Gorry, while I'm putting up the mare at the 'Saddle.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he whistled to the dog, which had been watching him from the
      hearthrug, and went out of the house. The handle of the whip dragged after
      him along the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gorry, full of trouble, took Kate to her room. Would she not eat her
      supper? Then salts were good for headache-should she bring a bottle from
      her box? After many fruitless inquiries and nervous protestations, the
      good soul bade Kate good-night and left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being alone, Kate broke into yet wilder paroxysms of weeping. The
      storm-cloud which had been gathering had burst at last. It seemed as if
      the whole weight of the day had been deferred until then. The piled-up
      hopes of weeks had waited for that hour, to be cast down in the sight of
      her own eyes. It was all over. The fight with Fate was done, and the
      frantic merriment with which she had kept down her sense of the place
      where the blind struggle had left her made the sick recoil more bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought of Philip, and her trouble began to moderate. Somewhere out of
      the uncrushed part of her womanhood there came one flicker of womanly
      pride to comfort her. She saw Philip at last from the point of revenge. He
      loved her; he would never cease to love her. Do what he might to banish
      the thought of her, she would be with him always; the more surely with
      him, the more reproachfully and unattainably, because she would be the
      wife of another man. If he could put her away from him in the daytime, and
      in the presence of those worldly aims for which he had sacrificed her,
      when night came he would be able to put her away no more. He would never
      sleep but he would see her. In every dream he would stretch out his arms
      to her, but she would not be there, and he would awake with sobs and in
      torment. There was a real joy in this thought, although it tore her heart
      so terribly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got strength from the cruel comforting, and Mrs. Gorry in the room
      below, listening intently, heard her crying cease. With her face still
      shut in both her hands, she was telling herself that she had nothing to
      reproach herself with; that she could not have acted differently; that she
      had not really made this marriage; that she had only submitted to it,
      being swept along by the pitiless tide, which was her father, and Pete,
      and everybody. She was telling herself, too, that, after all, she had done
      well. Here she lay in close harbour from the fierce storm which had
      threatened her. She was safe, she was at peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room lay still. The night was very quiet within those walls. Kate drew
      down her hands and looked about her. The fire was burning gently, and
      warming her foot on the sheepskin rug that lay in front of it. A lamp
      burned low on a table behind her chair. At one side there was a wardrobe
      of the shape of an old press, but with a tall mirror in the door; on the
      other side there was the bed, with the pink curtains hanging like a tent.
      The place had a strange look of familiarity. It seemed as if she had known
      it all her life. She rose to look around, and then the inner sense leapt
      to the outer vision, and she saw how it was. The room was a reproduction
      of her own bedroom at home, only newer and more luxurious. It was almost
      as if some ghost of herself had been there while she slept&mdash;as if her
      own hand had done everything in a dream of her girlhood wherein common
      things had become grand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate's eyes began to fill afresh, and she turned to take off her cloak. As
      she did so, she saw something on the dressing-table with a label attached
      to it. She took it up. It was a little mirror, a handglass like her own
      old one, only framed in ivory, and the writing on the label ran&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Insted of The one that is bruk with fond Luv to Kirry.

     peat.
</pre>
    <p>
      Her heart was now beating furiously. A flood of feeling had rushed over
      her. She dropped the glass as if it stung her fingers. With both hands she
      covered her face. Everything in the room seemed to be accusing her.
      Hitherto she had thought only of Philip. Now for the first time she
      thought of Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had wronged him&mdash;deeply, awfully, beyond atonement or hope of
      forgiveness. He loved her; he had married her; he had brought her to his
      home, to this harbour of safety, and she had deceived and betrayed him&mdash;she
      had suffered herself to be married to him while still loving another man.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden faintness seized her. She grew dizzy and almost fell. A more
      terrible memory had come behind. The thought was like ravens flapping
      their black wings on her brain. She felt her temples beating against her
      hands. They seemed to be sucking the life out of her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the voice of Pete came beating up the echoes between the house
      and the chapel beyond the garden&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Little red bird of the black turf ground,
          Where did you sleep last night?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      She heard him open the garden gate, clash it back, come up the path with
      an eager step, shut the door of the house and chain it on the inside. Then
      she heard his deep voice speaking below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better now, Mrs. Gorry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, better, sir, yes, and quiet enough this ten minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give her time, the bogh! Be aisy with the like, be aisy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently she heard him send off Mrs. Gorry for the night, saying he
      should want no supper, and should be going to bed soon. Then the house
      became quiet, and the smell of tobacco smoke came floating up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate's hot breath on her hands grew damp against her face. She felt
      herself swooning, and she caught hold of the mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot be,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;He must not come. I will go down to him and
      say, 'Pete, forgive me, I am really the wife of another.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she would tell him everything. Yes, she would confess all now. Oh,
      she would not be afraid. His love was great. He would do what she wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made one step towards the door, and was pulled up as by a curb. Pete
      would say, &ldquo;Do you mean that you have been using me as a cloak? Do you ask
      me to live in this house, side by side with you, and let no one suspect
      that we are apart? Then why did you not ask me yesterday? Why do you ask
      me to-day, when it is too late to choose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, she could not confess. If confession had been difficult yesterday, it
      was a thousand times more difficult to-day, and it would be a thousand
      thousand times more difficult tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate caught up the cloak she had thrown aside. She must go away. Anywhere,
      anywhere, no matter where. That was the one thing left to her&mdash;the
      only escape from the wild tangle of dread and pain. Pete was in the hall;
      there must be a way out at the back; she would find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lowered the lamp, and turned the handle of the door. Then she saw a
      light moving on the landing, and heard a soft step on the stairs. It was
      Pete, with a candle, coming up in his stockinged feet. He stopped midway,
      as if he heard the click of the latch, and then went noiselessly down
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate closed the door. She would not go. If she left the house that night
      she would cover Pete with suspicion and disgrace. The true secret would
      never be known; the real offender would never suffer; but the finger of
      scorn would be raised at the one man who had sheltered and shielded her,
      and he would die of humiliation and blind self-reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reflection restrained her for the moment, and when the stress of it
      was spent she was mastered by a fear that was far more terrible. For good
      or for all she was now married to Pete, and he had the rights of a
      husband. He had a right to come to her, and he <i>would</i> come. It was
      inevitable; it had to be. No boy or girl love now, no wooing, no dallying,
      no denying, but a grim reality of life&mdash;a reality that comes to every
      woman who is married to a man. She was married to Pete. In the eye of the
      world, in the eye of the law, she was his, and to fly from him was
      impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      She must remain. God himself had willed it As for the shame of her former
      relation to Philip, it was her own secret. God alone knew of it, and He
      would keep it safe. It was the dark chamber of her heart which God only
      could unlock. He would never unlock it until the Day of Judgment, and then
      Philip would be standing by her side, and she would cast it back upon him,
      and say, &ldquo;His, not mine, O God,&rdquo; and the Great Judge of all would judge
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she began to cry again, like a child in the dark. As she threw off her
      cloak a second time, her dress crinkled, and she looked down at it and
      remembered that it was her wedding-dress. Then she looked around at the
      room, and remembered that it was her wedding chamber. She remembered how
      she had dreamt of coming in her bridal dress to her bridal room&mdash;proud,
      afraid, tingling with love, blushing with joy, whispering to herself,
      &ldquo;This is for me&mdash;and this&mdash;and this. <i>He</i> has given it, for
      he loves me and I love him, and he is mine and I am his, and he is my love
      and my lord, and he is coming to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a gentle knocking at the door. It made her flesh creep. The
      knock came again. It went shrieking through and through her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kirry,&rdquo; whispered a voice from without.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only Pete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She neither spoke nor moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment, and then, half nervously, half jovially,
      half in laughter, half with emotion as if the heart outside was
      palpitating, the voice came again, &ldquo;I'm coming in, darling!&rdquo;

      I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next morning Kate said to herself, &ldquo;My life must begin again from to-day.&rdquo;
       She had a secret that Pete did not share, but she was not the first woman
      who had kept something from her husband. When people had secrets which it
      would hurt others to reveal, they ought to keep them close. Honour
      demanded that she should be as firm as a rock in blotting Philip from her
      soul. Remembering the promise which Pete had demanded of Philip at the
      wedding to make their house his home in Ramsey, and seeing that Philip
      must come, if only to save appearances, she asked herself if she ought to
      prevent him. But no! She resolved to conquer the passion that made his
      presence a danger. There was no safety in separation. In her relation to
      Philip she was like the convict who is beginning his life again&mdash;the
      only place where he can build up a sure career is precisely there where
      his crime is known. &ldquo;Let Philip come,&rdquo; she thought. She made his room
      ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was married. It was her duty to be a good wife. Pete loved her&mdash;his
      love would make it easy. They were sitting at breakfast in the
      hall-parlour, and she said, &ldquo;I should like to be my own housekeeper,
      Pete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And right, too,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Be your own woman, darling&mdash;not your
      woman's woman&mdash;and have Mrs. Gorry for your housemaid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To turn her mind from evil thoughts, she set to work immediately, and
      busied herself with little duties, little economies, little cares, little
      troubles. But the virtues of housekeeping were just those for which she
      had not prepared herself. Her first leg of mutton was roasted down to the
      proportions of a frizzled shank, and her first pudding was baked to the
      colour and consistency of a badly burnt brick. She did not mend rapidly as
      a cook, but Pete ate of all that his faultless teeth could grind through,
      and laid the blame on his appetite when his digestion failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She strove by other industries to keep alive a sense of her duty as a
      wife. Buying rolls of paper at the paperhanger's, she set about papering
      every closet in the house. The patterns did not join and the paste did not
      adhere. She initialled in worsted the new blankets sent by Grannie, with a
      P and a Q and a K intertwined. Than she overhauled the linen; turned out
      every room twice a week; painted every available wooden fixture with paint
      which would not dry because she had mixed it herself to save a sixpence a
      stone and forgotten the turpentine. Pete held up his hands in admiration
      at all her failures. She had thought it would be easy to be a good wife to
      a good husband. It was hard&mdash;hard for any one, hardest of all for
      her. There are the ruins of a happy woman in the bosom of every
      over-indulged wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not keep to anything long, but every night for a week she gave
      Pete lessons in reading, writing, and arithmetic. His reading was
      laborious, his spelling was eccentric, his figuring he did on the tips of
      his heavy fingers, and his writing he executed with his tongue in his
      cheek and his ponderous thumb down on the pen nib.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What letter is that, Pete?&rdquo; she said, pointing with her knitting needle
      to the page of a book of poems before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete looked up in astonishment. &ldquo;Is it <i>me</i> you're asking, Kitty? If
      <i>you</i> don't know, <i>I</i> don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a capital M, Pete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it, now?&rdquo; said Pete, looking at the letter with a searching eye.
      &ldquo;Goodness me, the straight it's like the gate of the long meadow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that's a capital A.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sakes alive, the straight it's like the coupling of the cart-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that's a B.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gough bless me, d'ye say so? But the straight it's like the hoof of a
      bull, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And M A B spells Mab&mdash;Queen Mab,&rdquo; said Kate, going on with her
      knitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete looked up at her with eyes wide open. &ldquo;I suppose, now,&rdquo; he said, in a
      voice of pride, &ldquo;I suppose you're knowing all the big spells yourself,
      Kitty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not all. Sometimes I have to look in the dictionary,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      She showed him the book and explained its uses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it taiching you to spell every word, Kitty?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every ordinary word,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gough!&rdquo; said Pete, touching the book with awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day he pored over the dictionary for an hour, but when he raised his
      face it wore a look of scepticism and scorn. &ldquo;This spelling-book isn't
      taiching you nothing, darling,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it. Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nothing,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Here I've been looking for an ordinary word&mdash;a
      <i>very</i> ordinary word&mdash;and it isn't in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What word is it?&rdquo; said Elate, leaning over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Love</i>,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;See,&rdquo; pointing his big forefinger, &ldquo;that's
      where it ought to be, and where is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>love</i> begins <i>lo</i>,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;and you're looking at <i>lu</i>.
      Here it is&mdash;love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete gave a prolonged whistle, then fell back in his chair, looked slowly
      up and said, &ldquo;So you must first know how the word begins; is that it,
      Kitty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it's you that's taiching the spelling-book, darling; so we'll put it
      back on the shelf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a fortnight Kate read and replied to Pete's correspondence. It was
      plentiful and various. Letters from heirs to lost fortunes offering shares
      in return for money to buy them out of Chancery; from promoters of
      companies proposing dancing palaces to meet the needs of English visitors;
      from parsons begging subscriptions to new organs; from fashionable ladies
      asking Pete to open bazaars; from preachers inviting him to anniversary
      tea-meetings, and saying Methodism was proud of him. If anybody wanted
      money, he kissed the Blarney Stone and applied to Pete. Kate stood between
      him and the worst of the leeches. The best of them he contrived to deal
      with himself, secretly and surreptitiously. Sometimes there came
      acknowledgments of charities of which Kate knew nothing. Then he would
      shuffle them away and she would try not to see them. &ldquo;If I stop him
      altogether, I will spoil him,&rdquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the post brought a large envelope with a great seal at the back of
      it, and Kate drew out a parchment deed and began to read the indorsement&mdash;&ldquo;'Memorandum
      of loan to Cæsar Cre&mdash;&mdash;-'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's nothing,&rdquo; said Pete, snatching the document and stuffing it into
      his jacket-pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate lifted her eyes with a look of pain and shame and humiliation, and
      that was the end of her secretaryship.

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A month after their marriage a man came through the gate with the air of
      one who was doing a degrading thing. The dog, which had been spread out
      lazily in the sun before the porch, leapt up and barked furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's this coming up the path with his eyes all round him like a
      scallop?&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate looked. &ldquo;It's Ross Christian,&rdquo; she said, with a catch in her
      breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ross came up, and Pete met him at the door. His face was puffy and pale,
      his speech was soft and lisping, yet there lurked about the man an air of
      levity and irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your dog doesn't easily make friends, Peter,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's like his master, sir; it's against the principles of his life,&rdquo; said
      Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ross laughed a little. &ldquo;Wants to be approached with consideration, does
      he, Capt'n?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, he's lived such a long time in the world and seen such a dale,&rdquo;
       said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ross looked up sharply and said in another tone, &ldquo;I've just dropped in to
      congratulate you on your return home in safety and health and prosperity,
      Mr. Quilliam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're welcome, sir,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete led the way indoors. Ross followed, bowed distantly to Kate, who was
      unpicking a dress, and took a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must not conceal from you, however, that I have another object&mdash;in
      fact, a private matter,&rdquo; said Ross, glancing at Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dress rustled in Kate's fingers, her scissors dropped on to the table,
      and she rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete raised his hand. &ldquo;My wife knows all my business,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ross gave out another little chirp of laughter. &ldquo;You'll remember what they
      say of a secret, Captain&mdash;too big for one, right for two, tight for
      three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man and his wife are one, sir&mdash;so that's two altogether,&rdquo; said
      Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate took up the scissors and went on with her work uneasily. Ross twisted
      on his seat and said, &ldquo;Well, I feel I <i>must</i> tell you, Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quilliam, sir,&rdquo; said Pete, charging a pipe; but Ross pretended not to
      hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only natural, perhaps, for it&mdash;in fact, it's about our father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tongue with me, tongue with thee,&rdquo; thought Pete, lighting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five years ago he made me an allowance, and sent me up to London to study
      law. He believes I've been called to the English bar, and, in view of this
      vacant Deemstership, he wants me admitted to the Manx one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete's pipe stopped in its puffing. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's impossible,&rdquo; said Ross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things haven't come with you, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you the truth, Captain, on first going up I fell into extravagant
      company. I thought my friends were rich men, and I was never a niggard.
      There was Monty, the patron of the Fancy&rdquo;&mdash;the scissors in Kate's
      hand clicked and stopped&mdash;and Ross blurted out, &ldquo;In fact, I've <i>not</i>
      been called, and I've never studied at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ross squirmed in his chair, glancing under his brows at Kate. Pete leaned
      forward and puffed up the chimney without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see I speak freely, Peter&mdash;something compels me. Well, if a man
      can't reveal his little failings to his own brother, Peter&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let's talk about brothers,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;What am I to do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lend me enough to help me to do what our father thinks I've done
      already,&rdquo; said Ross, and then he added, hastily, &ldquo;Oh, I'll give you my
      note of hand for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're telling me, sir,&rdquo; said Pete, &ldquo;your notes of hand are as cheap as
      cowries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one has belied me to you, Captain. But for our father's sake&mdash;he
      has set his heart on this Deemstership&mdash;there may still be time for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Pete, striking his open hand on the table, &ldquo;and better men to
      fill it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ross glanced at Kate, and a smile that was half a sneer crossed his evil
      face. &ldquo;How nice,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when the great friends of the wife are also
      the great friends of the husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Pete, and then Ross laughed a little, and the clicking of
      Kate's scissors stopped again. &ldquo;As to you, sir,&rdquo; said Pete, rising, &ldquo;if
      it's no disrespect, you're like the cormorant that chokes itself
      swallowing its fish head-ways up. The gills are sticking in your gizzard,
      sir, only,&rdquo; touching Ross's shoulder with something between a pat and
      push, &ldquo;you shouldn't be coming to your father's son to help you to ram it
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Ross went out Cæsar came in. &ldquo;That wastrel's been wanting something,&rdquo;
       said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tide's down on him,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always was, and always will be. He was born at low water, and he'll die
      on the rocks. Borrowing money, eh?&rdquo; said Cæsar, with a searching glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trying to,&rdquo; said Pete indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then lend it, sir,&rdquo; said Cæsar promptly. &ldquo;He's not to trust, but lend it
      on his heirship. Or lend it the ould man at mortgage on Ballawhaine. He's
      the besom of fire&mdash;it'll come to you, sir, at the father's death, and
      who has more right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shank of Pete's pipe came down from his mouth as he sat for some
      moments beating out the ash on the jockey bar. &ldquo;Something in that,
      though,&rdquo; he said mechanically. &ldquo;But there's another has first claim for
      all. He'd be having the place now if every one had his own. I must be
      thinking of it&mdash;I must be thinking of it.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Philip had left the island on the morning after the marriage. He had gone
      abroad, and when they heard from him first he was at Cairo. The voyage out
      had done him good&mdash;the long, steady nights going down the
      Mediterranean&mdash;walking the deck alone&mdash;the soft air&mdash;the
      far-off lights&mdash;thought he was feeling better&mdash;calmer anyway. He
      hoped they were settled in their new home, and well&mdash;and happy. Kate
      had to read the letter aloud. It was like a throb of Philip's heart made
      faint, feeble, and hardly to be felt by the great distance. Then she had
      to reply to it on behalf of Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him to be quick and come out of the land of Egypt and the house of
      bondage,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Say there's no manner of sense of a handsome young
      man living in a country where there isn't a pretty face to be seen on the
      sunny side of a blanket. Write that Kirry joins with her love and best
      respects and she's busy whitewashing, and he'd better have no truck with
      Pharaoh's daughters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next time they heard from Philip he was at Rome. He had suffered from
      sleeplessness, but was not otherwise unwell. Living in that city was like
      an existence after death&mdash;all the real life was behind you. But it
      was not unpleasant to walk under the big moon amid the wrecks of the past.
      He congratulated Mrs. Quilliam on her active occupation&mdash;work was the
      same as suffering&mdash;it was strength and power. Kate had to read this
      letter also. It was like a sob coming over the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him a merry touch to keep up his pecker,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Tell him the
      Romans are ter'ble jealous chaps, and, if he gets into a public house for
      a cup of tay, he's to mind and not take the girls on his knee&mdash;the
      Romans don't like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last time they heard from Philip he was in London. His old pain had
      given way; he thought he was nearly well again, but he had come through a
      sharp fire. The Governor had been very good&mdash;kept open the
      Deemstership by some means&mdash;also surrounded him with London friends&mdash;he
      was out every night. Nevertheless, an unseen force was drawing him home&mdash;they
      might see him soon, or it might be later he had been six months away, but
      he felt that it had not been all waste and interruption&mdash;he would
      return with a new sustaining power.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter could not be answered, for it bore no address. It came by the
      night-mail with the same day's steamer from England. Two hours later Mrs.
      Gorry ran in from an errand to the town saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe in my heart I saw Mr. Philip Christian going by on the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This minute,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chut! woman,&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;the man's in London. Look, here's his letter&rdquo;&mdash;running
      his forefinger along the headline&mdash;'"London, January 21st&mdash;that's
      yesterday. See!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gorry was perplexed. But the next night she was out at the same hour
      on the same errand, and came flying into the house with a scared look,
      making the same announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See for yourself, then,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;he's going up the lane by the
      garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! it's browning you're ateing with your barley,&rdquo; said Pete; and
      then to Kate, behind his hand, he whispered, &ldquo;Whisht! It's sights she's
      seeing, poor thing&mdash;and no wonder, with her husband laving her so
      lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the third night also Mrs. Gorry returned from a similar errand, at the
      same hour, with the same statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure of it,&rdquo; she panted. She was now in terror. An idea of the
      supernatural had taken hold of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman manes it,&rdquo; said Pete, and he began to cross-question her. How
      was Mr. Christian dressed? She hadn't noticed that night, but the first
      night he had worn a coat like an old Manx cape. Which way was he going?
      She couldn't be certain which way to-night but the night before he had
      gone up the lane between the chapel and the garden. Had she seen his face
      at all? The first time she had seen it, and it was very thin and pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wouldn't deceave you, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gorry, and she fell to
      crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gough bless me, but this is mortal strange, though,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time was it exactly, Jane?&rdquo; asked Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the minute of ten every night,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Gorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any difference in time, now,&rdquo; said Pete, &ldquo;between the Isle of
      Man and London, Kitty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to speak of,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete scratched his head. &ldquo;I must be putting a sight up on Black Tom. A
      dirty old trouss, God forgive me, if he is my grandfather, but he knows
      the Manx yarns about right. If it had been Midsummer day now, and Philip
      had been in bed somewhere, it might have been his spirit coming home while
      he was sleeping to where his heart is&mdash;they're telling of the like,
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate read the mystery after her own manner, and on the following night, at
      the approach of ten o'clock, she went into the parlour of the hall, whence
      a window looked out on to the road. The day had been dull and the night
      was misty. A heavy white hand seemed to have come down on to the face of
      sea and land. Everything lay still and dead and ghostly. Kate was in the
      dark room, trembling, but not with fear. Presently a form that was like a
      shadow passed under a lamp that glimmered opposite. She could see only the
      outlines of a Spanish cape. But she listened for the footsteps, and she
      knew them. They came on and paused, came up and paused again, and then
      they went past and deadened off and died in the dense night-air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate's eyes were red and swollen when she came back to supper. She had
      promised herself enjoyment of Philip's sufferings. There was no enjoyment,
      but only a cry of yearning from the deep place where love calls to love.
      She tried afresh to make the thought of Philip sink to the lowest depth of
      her being. It was hard&mdash;it was impossible; Pete was for ever
      strengthening the recollection of him&mdash;of his ways, his look, his
      voice, his laugh. What he said was only the echo of her own thoughts; but
      it was pain and torment, nevertheless. She felt like crying, &ldquo;Let me alone&mdash;let
      me alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      People in the town began to talk of Mrs. Gorry's mysterious stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip will be forced to come now,&rdquo; thought Kate; and he came. Kate was
      alone. It was afternoon; dinner was over, the hearth was swept, the fire
      was heaped up, and the rug was down. He entered the porch quietly, tapped
      lightly at the door, and stepped into the house. He hoped she was well.
      She answered mechanically. He asked after Pete. She replied vacantly that
      he had been gone since morning on some fishing business to Peel. It was a
      commonplace conversation&mdash;brief, cold, almost trivial. He spoke
      softly, and stood in the middle of the floor, swinging his soft hat
      against his leg. She was standing by the fire, with one hand on the
      mantelpiece and her head half aside, looking sideways towards his feet;
      but she noticed that his eyes looked larger than before, and that his
      voice, though so soft, had a deeper tone. At first she did not remember to
      ask him to sit, and when she thought of it she could not do so. The poor
      little words would have been a formal recognition of all that had happened
      so terribly&mdash;that she was mistress in that house, and the wife of
      Pete.

    <h2>
      IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      They were standing so, in a silence hard to break, harder still to keep
      up, when Pete himself came back, like a rush of wind, and welcomed Philip
      with both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit, boy, sit,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;not that one&mdash;this aisy one. Mine? Well,
      if it's mine, it's yours. Not had dinner, have you? Neither have I. Any
      cold mate left, Kitty? No? Fry us a chop, then, darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate had recovered herself by this time, and she went out on this errand.
      While she was away, Pete rattled on like a mill-race&mdash;asked about the
      travels, laughed about the girls, and roared about Mrs. Gorry and her
      ghost of Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been buying a Nickey at Peel to-day, Phil,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;good little boat&mdash;a
      reg'lar clipper. Aw, I'm going to start on the herrings myself next sayson
      sir, and what for shouldn't I? Too many of the Manx ones are giving the
      fishing the goby. There's life in the ould dog yet, though. Would be,
      anyway, if them rusty Kays would be doing anything for the industry.
      They're building piers enough for the trippers, but never a breakwater the
      size of a tooth-brush for the fishermen. That's reminding me, Phil&mdash;the
      boys are at me to get you to petition the Tynwald Court for better
      harbours. They're losing many a pound by not getting out all weathers. But
      if the child doesn't cry, the mother will be giving it no breast. So we
      mane to squall till they think in Douglas we've got spavined wind or
      population of the heart, or something. The men are looking to you, Phil.
      'That's the boy for us,' says they. 'He's stood our friend before, and
      he'll do it again,' they're saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip promised to draw up the petition, and then Mrs. Gorry came in and
      laid the cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate, meanwhile, had been telling herself that she had not done well.
      Where was the satisfaction she had promised herself on the night of her
      wedding-day, when she had seen Philip from the height of a great revenge,
      if she allowed him to think that she also was suffering? She must be
      bright, she must be gay, she must seem to be happy and in love with her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to the hall-parlour with a smoking dish, and a face all
      sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid they're not very good, dear,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chut!&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;we're not particular. Phil and I have roughed it
      before to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed merrily, and, under pretext of giving orders, disappeared
      again. But she had not belied the food she had set on the table. The
      mutton was badly fed, badly killed, badly cut, and, above all, badly
      cooked. To eat it was an ordeal. Philip tried hard not to let Pete see how
      he struggled. Pete fought valiantly to conceal his own efforts. The
      perspiration began to break out on their foreheads. Pete stopped in the
      midst of some wild talk to glance up at Philip. Philip tore away with
      knife and fork and answered vaguely. Then Pete looked searchingly around,
      rose on tiptoe, went stealthily to the kitchen door, came back, caught up
      a piece of yellow paper from the sideboard, whipped the chops into it from
      his own plate and then from Philip's, and crammed them into his jacket
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No good hurting anybody's feelings,&rdquo; said he; and then Kate reappeared
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finished already?&rdquo; she said with an elevation of pitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; laughed Pete. &ldquo;Two hungry men, Kate! You'd rather keep us a week
      than a fortnight, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate stood over the empty dish with a look of surprise. Pete winked
      furiously at Philip. Philip's eyes wandered about the tablecloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>She</i> isn't knowing much about a hungry man's appetite, is she,
      Phil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Kate&mdash;&ldquo;but,&rdquo; she stammered&mdash;&ldquo;what's become of the
      bones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete scratched his chin through his beard. &ldquo;The bones? Oh, the bones? Aw,
      no, we're not ateing the bones, at all.&rdquo; Then with a rush, as his eyes
      kindled, &ldquo;But the dog, you see&mdash;coorse we always give the bones to
      the dog&mdash;Dempster's dead on bones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dempster was lying at the moment full length under the table, snoring
      audibly. Mrs. Gorry cleared the cloth, and Kate took up her sewing and
      turned towards the sideboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has any one seen my pattern?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pattern?&rdquo; said Pete, diving into his jacket-pocket. &ldquo;D'ye say pattern,&rdquo;
       he muttered, rummaging at his side. &ldquo;Is this it?&rdquo; and out came the yellow
      paper, crumpled and greasy, which had gone in with the chops. &ldquo;Bless me,
      the stupid a man is now&mdash;I took it for a pipe-light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate's smile vanished, and she fled out to hide her face. Then Pete
      whispered to Philip, &ldquo;Let's take a slieu round to the 'Plough.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were leaving the house on that errand when Kate came back to the
      hall. &ldquo;Just taking a lil walk, Kirry,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;They're telling me it's
      good wonderful after dinner for a wake digestion of the chest,&rdquo; and he
      coughed repeatedly and smote his resounding breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment and I'll go with you,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no help for it. Kate's shopping took them in the direction of
      the &ldquo;Plough.&rdquo; Old Mrs. Beatty, the innkeeper, was at the door as they
      passed, and when she saw Pete approaching on the inside of the three, she
      said aloud&mdash;meaning no mischief&mdash;&ldquo;Your bread and cheese and
      porter are ready, as usual, Capt'n.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The man was killing her. To be his spoiled and adored wife, knowing she
      was unworthy of his love and tenderness, was not happiness&mdash;it was
      grinding misery, bringing death into her soul. If he had blamed her for
      her incompetence; if he had scolded her for making his home cheerless;
      nay, if he had beaten her, she could have borne with life, and taken her
      outward sufferings for her inward punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell into fits of hysteria, sat whole hours listless, with her feet on
      the fender. Pete's conduct exasperated her. As time went on and developed
      the sweetness of Pete, the man grew more and more distasteful to her, and
      she broke into fits of shrewishness. Pete hung his head and reproached
      himself. She wasn't to mind if he said things&mdash;he was only a rough
      fellow. Then she burst into tears and asked him to forgive her, and he was
      all cock-a-hoop in a moment, like a dog that is coaxed after it has been
      beaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sufferings reached a climax&mdash;she became conscious that she was
      about to become a mother. This affected her with terrible fears. She went
      back to that thought of a possible contingency which had torn her with
      conflicting feelings on the eve of her marriage. It was impossible to be
      sure. The idea might be no more than a morbid fancy, born of her
      un-happiness, of her secret love for Philip, of her secret repugnance for
      Pete (the inadequate, the uncouth, the uncongenial) but nevertheless it
      possessed her with the force of an overpowering conviction, it grew upon
      her day by day, it sat on her heart like a nightmare&mdash;the child that
      was to be born to her was not the child of her husband.

    <h2>
      VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In spite of Pete's invitations, Philip came rarely. He was full of excuses&mdash;work&mdash;fresh
      studies&mdash;the Governor&mdash;his aunt. Pete said &ldquo;Coorse,&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Sartenly,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wouldn't trust,&rdquo; until Philip began to be ashamed, and
      one evening he came, looking stronger than usual, with a more sustaining
      cheerfulness, and plumped into the house with the words, &ldquo;I've come at
      last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To stay the night?&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's lucky and unlucky too, for I'm this minute for Peel with two of
      the boys to fetch round my Nickey by the night-tide. But youll stay and
      keep the wife company, and I'll be back first tide in the morning. You'll
      be obliged to him, won't you, Kate?&rdquo; he cried, pitching his voice over his
      shoulder; and then, in a whisper, &ldquo;She's a bit down at whiles, and what
      wonder, and her so near&mdash;but you'll see, you'll see,&rdquo; and he winked
      and nodded knowingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no harking back, no sheering off on the score of modesty before
      Pete's large faith. Kate looked as if she would cry &ldquo;Mercy, mercy!&rdquo; but
      when she saw the same appeal on Philip's face she was stung.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete went off, and then Kate and Philip sat down to tea. While tea lasted
      it was not hard to fill the silences with commonplaces. After it was over
      she brought him a pipe, and they lapsed into difficult pauses. Philip
      puffed vigorously and tried to look happy. Kate struggled not to let
      Philip see that she was ill at ease. Every moment their imagination took a
      new turn. He began to read a book, and while they sat without speaking she
      thought it was hardly nice of him to treat her with indifference. When he
      spoke she thought he was behaving with less politeness than before. He
      went over to the piano and they sang a part song, &ldquo;Oh, who will o'er the
      downs so free?&rdquo; Their voices went well enough together, but they broke
      down. The more they tried to forget the past the more they remembered it.
      He twiddled the backs of his fingertips over the keyboard; she swung on
      one foot and held to the candle-bracket while they talked of Pete. That
      name seemed to fortify them against the scouts of passion. Pete was their
      bulwark. It was the old theme, but played as a tragedy, not as a comedy,
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is delightful to see you settled in this beautiful home,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Isn't</i> it beautiful?&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to be very happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I not be happy?&rdquo; with a little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, indeed? A home like a nest and a husband that worships you&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed again because she could not speak. Speech was thin gauze,
      laughter was rolling smoke; so she laughed and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fine hearty creature he is!&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't he?&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Education and intellect don't always go together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any wife might love such a husband,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So simple, so natural, so unsuspicious&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But that was coming to quarters too close, so they fell back on silence.
      The silence was awful; the power of it was pitiless. If they could have
      spoken the poorest commonplaces, the spell might have dissolved. Philip
      thought he would rise, but he could not do so. Kate tried to turn away,
      but felt herself rooted to the spot. With faces aside, they remained some
      moments where they were, as if a spirit had passed between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gorry came in to lay the supper, and then Kate recovered herself. She
      got back her power of laughter, and laughed at everything. He was not
      deceived. &ldquo;She loves me still,&rdquo; said the voice of his heart. He hated
      himself for the thought, but it haunted him with a merciless persistence.
      He remembered the evening of the wedding-day, and the imploring look she
      gave him on going away with Pete; and he returned to the idea that she had
      been married under the compulsion of her father, Cæsar, the avaricious
      hypocrite. He told himself it would be easy to kindle a new fire on the
      warm hearth. As she laughed and he looked into her beautiful eyes and
      caught the nervous twitch of her mouth, he felt something of the old
      thrill, the old passion, the old unconditioned love of her who loved him
      in spite of all, and merely because she must. But no! Had he spent six
      months abroad for nothing? He would be strong; he would be loyal. If need
      be he would save this woman from herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Kate lit a candle and said, &ldquo;I must show you to your room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She talked cheerily going upstairs. On the landing she opened the door of
      the room above the hall, and went into it, and drew down the blind. She
      was still full of good spirits, said perhaps he had no night-shirt, so she
      had left out one of Pete's, hoped he would find it big enough, and laughed
      again. He took the candle from her at the threshold, and kissed the hand
      that had held it. She stood a moment quivering like a colt, then she
      bounded away; there was the clash of a door somewhere beyond, and Kate was
      in her own room, kneeling before the bed with her face buried in the
      counterpane to stifle the sobs that might break through the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under all her lightness, in spite of all her laughter, the old tormenting
      thought had been with her still. Should she tell him? Could he understand?
      Would he believe? If he realised the gravity of the awful position in
      which she was soon to be placed, would he make an effort to extricate her?
      And if he did not, would not, could not, should not she hate him for ever
      after? Then the old simple love, the pure passion, came hack upon her at
      the sight of his face, at the touch of his hand, at the sound of his
      voice? Oh, for what might have been&mdash;what might have been!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete's Nickey came into harbour with the morning tide, and the three
      breakfasted together. As Kate moved heavily in front of the fire, Pete
      crowed, cooed, and scattered wise winks round the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More milk, mammy,&rdquo; he whimpered, and then he imitated all kinds of baby
      prattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast the men smoked, and Kate took up her sewing. She was
      occupying herself with the little labours, so pretty, so full of delicate
      humour and delicious joy, which usually open a new avenue for a woman's
      tenderness. Philip's eyes fell on her, and she dropped below into her lap
      the tiny piece of white linen she was working on. Pete saw this, stole to
      the back of her chair, reached over her shoulder, snatched the white thing
      out of her fingers, held it outstretched in his ponderous hands, and
      roared like a smithy bellows. It was a baby's shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, darling,&rdquo; he coaxed, as the colour leapt to Kate's face.
      &ldquo;Philip must be a sort of a father to the boy some day&mdash;a godfather,
      anyway&mdash;so he won't mind seeing his lil shiff. We must be calling him
      Philip, too. What do you say, Kirry&mdash;Philip, is it agreed?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As her time drew near, the conviction deepened upon her that she could not
      be confined in her husband's house. Being there at such a crisis was like
      living in a volcanic land. One false step, one passionate impulse, and the
      very earth under her feet would split. &ldquo;I must go home for awhile, Pete,&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coorse you must,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Nobody like the ould angel when a girl's
      that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete took her back to her mother's in the gig, driving very slowly, and
      lifting her up and down as tenderly as if she had been a child. She
      breathed freely when she left Elm Cottage, but when she was settled in her
      own bedroom at &ldquo;The Manx Fairy&rdquo; she realised that she had only stepped
      from misery to misery. So many memories lived like ghosts there&mdash;memories
      of innocent slumbers, and of gleeful awakenings amid the twittering of
      birds and the rattling of gravel. The old familiar place, the little room
      with the poor little window looking out on the orchard, the poor little
      bed with its pink curtains like a tent, the sweet old blankets, the
      wash-basin, the press, the blind with the same old pattern, the sheepskin
      rug underfoot, the whitewashed scraas overhead&mdash;everything the same,
      but, O God! how different!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me look at myself in the glass, Nancy,&rdquo; she said, and Nancy gave her
      the handglass which had been cracked the morning after the Melliah.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pushed it away peevishly. &ldquo;What's the use of a thing like that?&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete haunted the house day and night. There was no bed for him there, and
      he was supposed to go home to sleep. But he wandered away in the darkness
      over the Curragh to the shore, and in the grey of morning he was at the
      door again, bringing the cold breath of the dawn into the house with the
      long whisper round the door ajar. &ldquo;How's she going on now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The women bundled him out bodily, and then he hung about the roads like a
      dog disowned. If he heard a sigh from the dairy loft, he sat down against
      the gable and groaned. Grannie tried to comfort him. &ldquo;Don't be taking on
      so, boy. It'll be all joy soon,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and you'll be having the child
      to shew for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Pete was bitter and rebellious. &ldquo;Who's wanting the child anyway?&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;It's only herself I'm wanting; and she's laving me; O Lord, she's
      laving me. God forgive me!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;O good God, forgive me!&rdquo; he
      groaned: &ldquo;It isn't fair, though. Lord knows it isn't fair,&rdquo; he mumbled
      hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Nancy Joe came out and took him in hand in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Pete,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you're wanting to kill the woman, and
      middling quick too, you'll go on the way you're going. But if you don't,
      you'll be taking to the road, and you won't be coming back till you're
      wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This settled Pete's restlessness. The fishing had begun early that season,
      and he went off for a night to the herrings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate waited long, and the women watched her with trembling. &ldquo;It's a week
      or two early,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;The weather's warm,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;The boghee
      millish! She's a bit soon,&rdquo; said Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was less of fear in Kate's own feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do women often die?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The proportion is small,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour afterwards she spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the child sometimes die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've known it to happen, but only when the mother has had a shock&mdash;lost
      her husband, for example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lay tossing on the bed, wishing for her own death, hoping for the
      death of the unborn child, dreading its coming lest she should hate and
      loathe it. At last came the child's first cry&mdash;that cry out of
      silence that had never broken on the air before, but was henceforth to be
      one of the world's voices for laughter and for weeping, for joy and for
      sorrow, to her who had borne it into life. Then she called to them to show
      her the baby, and when they did so, bringing it up with soft cooings and
      foolish words, she searched the little wrinkled face with a frightened
      look, then put up her arms to shut out the sight, and cried &ldquo;Take it
      away,&rdquo; and turned to the wall. Her vague fear was a certainty now; the
      child was the child of her sin&mdash;she was a bad woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet there is no shame, no fear, no horror, but the pleading of a new-born
      babe can drown its clamour. The child cried again, and the cruel battle of
      love and dread was won for motherhood. The mother heart awoke and swelled.
      She had got her baby, at all events. It was all she had for all she had
      suffered; but it was enough, and a dear and precious prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure it is well?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Quite, quite well? Doesn't its
      little face look as if its mammy had been crying&mdash;no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Deed no,&rdquo; said Grannie, &ldquo;but as bonny a baby as ever was born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The women were scurrying up and down, giggling on the landings, laughing
      on the stairs, and saying <i>hush</i> at their own noises as they crept
      into the room. In a fretful whimper the child was still crying, and
      Grannie was telling it, with many wags of the head and in a mighty stern
      voice, that they were going to have none of its complaining now that it <i>had</i>
      come at last; and Kate Herself, with hands clasped together, was saying in
      a soft murmur like a prayer, &ldquo;God is very good, and the doctor is good
      too. God is good to give us doctors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lie quiet, and I'll come back in an hour or two,&rdquo; said Dr. Mylechreest
      from half-way through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear heart alive, what will the father say?&rdquo; cried Grannie, and then the
      whole place broke into that smile of surprise which comes to every house
      after the twin angels of Life and Death have brooded long over its
      roof-tree, and are gone at length before the face of a little child.

      VIII.

    <p>
      When Pete came up to the quay in the raw sunshine of early morning, John
      the Clerk, mounted on a barrel, was selling by auction the night's take of
      the boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've news for you, Mr. Quilliam,&rdquo; he cried, as Pete's boat, with half
      sail set, dropped down the harbour. Pete brought to, leapt ashore, and
      went up to where John, at the end of the jetty, surrounded by a crowd of
      buyers in little spring-carts, was taking bids for the fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, Capt'n,&rdquo; he cried, across his outstretched arm, at the end
      whereof was a herring with gills still opening and closing. &ldquo;Ten maise of
      this sort for the last lot, well fed, alive and kicking&mdash;how much for
      them? Five shillings? Thank you&mdash;and three, Five and three. It's in
      it yet, boys&mdash;only five and three&mdash;and six, thank <i>you</i>.
      It'll do no harm at five and six&mdash;six shillings? All done at six&mdash;<i>and
      six?</i> All done at six and six?&rdquo; &ldquo;Seven shillings,&rdquo; shouted somebody
      with a voice like a foghorn. &ldquo;They're Annie the Cadger's,&rdquo; said John,
      dropping to the ground. &ldquo;And now, Capt'n Quilliam, we'll go and wet the
      youngster's head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete went up to Sulby like an avalanche, shouting his greetings to
      everybody on the way. But when he got near to the &ldquo;Fairy,&rdquo; he wiped his
      steaming forehead and held his panting breath, and pretended not to have
      heard the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's the poor girl now?&rdquo; he said in a meek voice, trying to look
      powerfully miserable, and playing his part splendidly for thirty seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the women made eyes at each other and looked wondrous knowing, and
      nodded sideways at Pete, and clucked and chuckled, saying, &ldquo;Look at him,&mdash;<i>he</i>
      doesn't know anything, does he?&rdquo; &ldquo;Coorse not, woman&mdash;these men
      creatures are no use for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of a man's way,&rdquo; cried Pete, with a roar, and he made a rush for the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy blocked him at the foot of them with both hands on his shoulders.
      &ldquo;You'll be quiet, then,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;You were always a rasonable man,
      Pete, and she's wonderful wake&mdash;promise you'll be quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;TO be like a mouse,&rdquo; said Pete, and he whipped off his long sea-boots and
      crept on tiptoe into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There she lay with the morning light on her, and a face as white as the
      quilt that she was plucking with her long fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God for a living mother and a living child,&rdquo; said Pete, in a broken
      gurgle, and then he drew down the bedclothes a very little, and there,
      too, was the child on the pillow of her other arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then do what he would to be quiet, he could not help but make a shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's there! Yes, he is! He is, though! Joy! Joy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The women were down on him like a flock of geese. &ldquo;Out of this, sir, if
      you can't behave better!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, ladies,&rdquo; said Pete humbly, &ldquo;I'm not in the habit of babies. A
      bit excited, you see, Mistress Nancy, ma'am. Couldn't help putting a bull
      of a roar out, not being used of the like.&rdquo; Then, turning back to the bed,
      &ldquo;Aw, Kitty, the beauty it is, though! And the big! As big as my fist
      already. And the fat! It's as fat as a bluebottle. And the straight! Well,
      not so <i>very</i> straight, neither, but the complexion at him now! Give
      him to me, Kitty I give him to me, the young rascal. Let me have a hould
      of him, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Him</i>, indeed! Listen to the man,&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a girl, Pete,&rdquo; said Grannie, lifting the child out of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A girl, is it?&rdquo; said Pete doubtfully. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, with a wag of the
      head, &ldquo;thank God for a girl.&rdquo; Then, with another and more resolute wag,
      &ldquo;Yes, thank God for a living mother and a living child, if it is a girl,&rdquo;
       and he stretched out his arms to take the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aisy, now, Pete&mdash;aisy,&rdquo; said Grannie, holding it out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it aisy broke they are, Grannie?&rdquo; said Pete. A good spirit looked out
      of his great boyish face. &ldquo;Come to your ould daddie, you lil sandpiper.
      Gough bless me, Kitty, the weight of him, though! This child's a quarter
      of a hundred if he's an ounce. He is, I'll go bail he is. Look at him! Guy
      heng, Grannie, did ye ever see the like, now! It's absolute perfection.
      Kitty, I couldn't have had a better one if I'd chiced it. Where's that Tom
      Hommy now? The bleating little billygoat, he was bragging outrageous about
      his new baby&mdash;saying he wouldn't part with it for two of the best
      cows in his cow-house. This'll floor him, I'm thinking. What's that you're
      saying, Mistress Nancy, ma'am? No good for nothing, am I? You were right,
      Grannie. 'It'll be all joy soon,' you were saying, and haven't we the
      child to show for it? I put on my stocking inside out on Monday, ma'am.
      'I'm in luck,' says I, and so I was. Look at that, now! He's shaking his
      lil fist at his father. He is, though. This child knows me. Aw, you're
      clever, Nancy, but&mdash;no nonsense at all, Mistress Nancy, ma'am.
      Nothing will persuade me but this child knows me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear the man?&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;<i>He</i> and <i>he</i>, and <i>he</i>
      and <i>he!</i> It's a girl, I'm telling you; a girl&mdash;a girl&mdash;a
      girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, a girl, then&mdash;a girl we'll make it,&rdquo; said Pete, with
      determined resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's deceaved,&rdquo; said Grannie. &ldquo;It was a boy he was wanting, poor fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Pete scoffed at the idea. &ldquo;A boy? Never! No, no&mdash;a girl for your
      life. I'm all for girls myself, eh, Kitty? Always was, and now I've got
      two of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child began to cry, and Grannie took it back and rocked it, face
      downwards, across her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness me, the voice at him!&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;It's a skipper he's born for&mdash;a
      harbour-master, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child slept, and Grannie put it on the pillow turned lengthwise at
      Kate's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quiet as a Jenny Wren, now,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Look at the bogh smiling in his
      sleep. Just like a baby mermaid on the egg of a dogfish. But where's the
      ould man at all? Has he seen it? We must have it in the papers. The <i>Times?</i>Yes,
      and the 'Tiser too. 'The beloved wife of Mr. Capt'n Peter Quilliam, of a
      boy&mdash;a girl,' I mane. Aw, the wonder there'll be all the island over&mdash;everybody
      getting to know. Newspapers are like women&mdash;ter'ble bad for keeping
      sacrets. What'll Philip say? But haven't you a toothful of anything,
      Grannie? Gin for the ladies, Nancy. Goodness me, the house is handy. What
      time was it? Wait, don't tell me! It was five o'clock this morning, wasn't
      it? Yes? Gough bless me, I knew it! High water to the very minute&mdash;aw,
      he'll rise in the world, and die at the top of the tide. How did I know
      when the child was born, ma'am? As aisy as aisy. We were lying adrift of
      Cronk ny Irrey Lhaa, looking up for daylight by the fisherman's clock.
      Only light enough to see the black of your nail, ma'am. All at once I
      heard a baby's cry on the waters. 'It's the nameless child of Earey
      Cushin,' sings out one of the boys. 'Up with the clout,' says I. And when
      we were hauling the nets and down on our knees saying a bit of a prayer,
      as usual, 'God bless my new-born child,' says I, 'and God bless my child's
      mother, too,' I says, and God love and protect them always, and keep and
      presarve myself as well.'&rdquo; There was a low moaning from the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Air! Give me air! Open the door!&rdquo; Kate gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The room is getting too hot for her,&rdquo; said Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, there's one too many of us here,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;Out of it,&rdquo; and she
      swept Pete from the bedroom with her apron as if he had been a drove of
      ducks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete glanced backward from the door, and a cloak that was hanging on the
      inside of it brushed his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless her!&rdquo; he said in a low tone. &ldquo;God bless and reward her for
      going through this for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he touched the cloak with his lips and disappeared. A moment later
      his curly black poll came stealing round the door jamb, half-way down,
      like the head of a big boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy,&rdquo; in a whisper, &ldquo;put the tongs over the cradle; it's a pity to
      tempt the fairies. And, Grannie, I wouldn't lave it alone to go out to the
      cow-house&mdash;the lil people are shocking bad for changing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate, with her face to the wall, listened to him with an aching heart. As
      Pete went down the doctor returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's hardly so well,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Better not let her nurse the
      child. Bring it up by hand. It will be best for both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So it was arranged that Nancy should be made nurse and go to Elm Cottage,
      and that Mrs. Gorry should come in her place to Sulby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout four-and-twenty hours thereafter, Kate tried her utmost to shut
      her heart to the child. At the end of that time, being left some minutes
      alone with the little one, she was heard singing to it in a sweet, low
      tone. Nancy paused with the long brush in her hand in the kitchen, and
      Granny stopped at her knitting in the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's something like, now,&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing, poor Kirry! What wonder if she was a bit out of her head, the
      bogh, and her not well since her wedding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They crept upstairs together at the unaccustomed sounds, and found Pete,
      whom they had missed, outside the bedroom door, half doubled up and
      holding his breath to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said he, less with his tongue than with his mouth, which he pursed
      out to represent the sound. Then he whispered, &ldquo;She's filling all the room
      with music. Listen! It's as good as fairy music in Glentrammon. And it's
      the little fairy itself that's 'ticing it out of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day Philip came, and nothing would serve for Pete but that he should
      go up to see the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only Phil,&rdquo; he said, through the doorway, dragging Philip into
      Kate's room after him, for the familiarity that a great joy permits breaks
      down conventions. Kate did not look up, and Philip tried to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's got good news for himself, too&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;They're to be making him
      Dempster a month to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Kate lifted her eyes to Philip's face, and all the glory of success
      withered under her gaze. He stumbled downstairs, and hurried away. There
      was the old persistent thought, &ldquo;She loves me still,&rdquo; but it was working
      now, in the presence of the child, with how great a difference! When he
      looked at the little, downy face, a new feeling took possession of him.
      Her child&mdash;hers&mdash;that might have been his also! Had his bargain
      been worth having? Was any promotion in the world to be set against one
      throb of Pete's simple joy, one gleam of the auroral radiance that lights
      up a poor man's home when he is first a father, one moment of divine
      partnership in the babe that is fresh from God?
    </p>
    <p>
      Three weeks later, Pete took his wife home in Cæsar's gig. Everything was
      the same, as when he brought her, save that within the shawls with which
      she was wrapped about the child now lay with its pink eyelids to the sky,
      and its fiat white bottle against her breast. It was a beautiful spring
      morning, and the young sunlight was on the sallies of the Curragh and the
      gold of the roadside gorse. Pete was as silly as a boy, and he chirped and
      croaked all the way home like every bird and beast of heaven and earth.
      When they got to Elm Cottage, he lifted his wife down as tenderly as if
      she had been the babe she had in her arms. He was strong and she was
      light, and he half helped, half carried her to the porch door. Nancy was
      there to take the child out of her hands, and, as she did so, Pete, back
      at the horse's head, cried, &ldquo;That's the last bit of furniture the house
      was waiting for, Nancy. What's a house without a child? Just a room
      without a clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clock, indeed,&rdquo; said Nancy; &ldquo;clocks are stopping, but this one's for
      going like a mill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be tempting the Nightman, Nancy,&rdquo; cried Pete; but he was full of
      childlike delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate stepped inside. The fire burned in the hall parlour, the fire-irons
      shone like glass, there were sprigs of fuchsia-bud in the ornaments on the
      chimneypiece&mdash;everything was warm and cheerful and homelike. She sat
      down without taking off her hat. &ldquo;Why can't I be quiet and happy?&rdquo; she
      thought. &ldquo;Why can't I make myself love him and forget?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she was like one who traversed a desert under the sea&mdash;a vast
      submerged Sahara. Over her head was all her life, with all her love and
      all her happiness, and the things around her were only the ghostly shadows
      cast by them.

    <h2>
      IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The more Kate realised that she was in the position of a bad woman, the
      more she struggled to be a good one. She flew to religion as a refuge.
      There was no belief in her religion, no faith, no creed, no mystical
      transports, but only fear, and shame, and contrition. It was fervent
      enough, nevertheless. On Sunday morning she went to The Christians, on
      Sunday afternoon to church, on Sunday evening to the Wesleyan chapel, and
      on Wednesday night to the mission-house of the Primitives. Her catholicity
      did not please her father. He looked into her quivering face, and asked if
      she had broken any commandment in secret. She turned pale, and answered
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete followed her wherever she went, and, seeing this, some of the baser
      sort among the religious people began to follow him. They abused each
      other badly in their efforts to lay hold of his money-bags. &ldquo;You'll never
      go over to yonder lot,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;They're holding to election&mdash;a
      soul-destroying doctrine.&rdquo; &ldquo;A respectable man can't join himself to
      Cowley's gang,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;They're denying original sin, and aren't a
      ha'p'orth better than infidels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete took the measure of them all, down to the watch-pockets of their
      waistcoats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remind me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when you're a-gate on your doctrines, of the
      Kaffirs out at Kimberley. If one of them found an ould hat in the compound
      that some white man had thrown away, they'd light a camp-fire after dark,
      and hould a reg'lar Tynwald Coort on it. There they'd be squatting round
      on their haunches, with nothing to be seen of them but their eyes and
      their teeth, and there'd be as many questions as the Catechism. '<i>Who</i>
      found it!' says one. '<i>Where</i> did he find it?' says another. 'If <i>he</i>
      hadn't found it, who else would have found it?' That's how they'd be going
      till two in the morning, and the fire dead out, and the lot of them
      squealing away same as monkeys in the dark. And all about an ould hat with
      a hole in it, not worth a ha'penny piece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blasphemy,&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;But still and for all, you give to the widow and
      lend to the Lord&mdash;you practise the religion you don't believe in,
      Cap'n Quilliam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a pair of us, then.&rdquo; said Pete, &ldquo;for you believe in the religion
      you don't practise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Cæsar got Pete at last, in spite of his scepticism. The time came for
      the annual camp-meeting. Kate went off to it, and Pete followed like a big
      dog at her heels. The company assembled at Sulby Bridge, and marched
      through the village to a revival chorus. They stopped at a field of
      Cæsar's in the glen&mdash;it was last year's Melliah field&mdash;and Cæsar
      mounted a cart which had been left there to serve as a pulpit. Then they
      sang again, and, breaking up into many companies, went off into little
      circles that were like gorse rings on the mountains. After that they
      reassembled to the strains of another chorus, and gathered afresh about
      the cart for Cæsar's sermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It dealt with the duty of sinless perfection. There were evil men and
      happy sinners in the island these days, who were telling them it was not
      good to be faultless in this life, because virtue begot pride, and pride
      was a deadly sin. There were others who were saying that because a man
      must repent in order to be saved, to repent he had to sin. Doctrines of
      the devil&mdash;don't listen to them. Could a man in the household of
      faith live one second without committing sin? Of course he could. One
      minute? Certainly. One hour? No doubt of it. Then, if a man could live one
      hour without sin, he could live one day, one week, one month, one year&mdash;nay,
      a whole lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      In getting thus far, Cæsar had worked himself into a perspiration, and he
      took off his coat, hung it over the cartwheel, and went on in his
      shirt-sleeves. Let them make no excuses for backsliders. It was a trick of
      the devil to deal with you, and forget to pay strap (the price). It was an
      old rule and a good one that, if any were guilty of the sins of the flesh,
      they should be openly punished in this world, that their sins might not be
      counted against them in the day of the Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar threw off his waistcoat and finished with a passionate exhortation,
      calling upon his hearers to deliver themselves of secret sins. If oratory
      is to be judged of by its effects, Cæsar's sermon was a great oration. It
      began amid the silence of his own followers, and the <i>tschts</i> and <i>pshaws</i>
      of a little group of his enemies, who lounged on the outside of the crowd
      to cast ridicule on the &ldquo;swaddler&rdquo; and the &ldquo;publican preacher.&rdquo; But it
      ended amid loud exclamations of praise and supplications from all his
      hearers, sighing and groaning, and the bodily clutching of one another by
      the arm in paroxysms of fear and rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Cæsar's voice died down like a wave of the sea, somebody leapt up
      from the grass to pray. And before the first prayer had ended, a second
      was begun. Meantime the penitents had begun to move inward through the
      throng, and they fell weeping and moaning on their knees about the cart.
      Kate was among them, and, when she took her place, Pete still held by her
      side A strong shuddering passed over her shoulders, and her wet eyes were
      on the grass. Pete took her hand, and feeling how it trembled, his own
      eyes also filled. Above their heads Cæsar was towering with fiery eyes and
      face aflame. In a momentary pause between two prayers, he tossed his voice
      up in a hymn. The people joined him at the second bar, and then the
      wailing of the penitents was drowned in a general shout of the revival
      tune&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;If some poor wandering child of Thine
     Have spurned to-day the voice divine,
     Now, Lord, the gracious work begin,
     Let him no more lie down in sin.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Kate sobbed aloud&mdash;poor vessel of human passions tossed about,
      tormented by the fire that was consuming her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the penitents grew calmer, they rose one by one to give their
      experience of Satan and salvation. At length Cæsar seized his opportunity
      and said, &ldquo;And now Brother Quilliam will give us his experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete rose from Kate's side with tearful eyes amid a babel of jubilation,
      most of it facetious. &ldquo;Be of good cheer, Peter, be not afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've not much to tell,&rdquo; said Pete&mdash;&ldquo;only a story of backsliding.
      Before I earned enough to carry me up country, I worked a month at Cape
      Town with the boats. My master was a pious old Dutchman getting the name
      of Jan. One Saturday night a big ship lost her anchor outside, and on
      Sunday morning forty pounds was offered for finding it. All the boatmen
      went out except Jan. 'Six days shalt thou labour,' says he, 'but the
      seventh is the Sabbath.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete's address was here punctuated by loud cries of thanksgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All day long he was seeing the boats beating up the bay, so, to keep out
      of temptation, he was going up to the bedroom and pulling the blind and
      getting down on his knees and wrastling like mad. And something out of
      heaven was saying to him, 'It's the Lord's day, Jannie; they'll not get a
      ha'p'orth.' Neither did they; but when Jan's watch said twelve o'clock
      midnight the pair of us were going off like rockets. Well, we hadn't been
      ten minutes on the water before our grapplings had hould of that anchor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were loud cries of &ldquo;Glory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jan was shouting, 'The Lord has put us atop of it as straight as the lid
      of a taypot!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Great cries of &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when we came ashore we found Jan's watch was twenty minutes fast, and
      that was the end of the ould man's religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That day the word went round that both Pete and Kate had been converted.
      Their names were entered in Class, and they received their quarterly
      tickets.

    <p>
      Next morning Kate set out to church for her churching. Her household
      duties had lost their interest by this time, and she left Nancy to cook
      the dinner. Pete had volunteered to take charge of the child. This he
      began to do by establishing himself with his pipe in an armchair by the
      cradle, and looking steadfastly down into it until the little one awoke.
      Then he rocked it, rummaged his memory for a nursery song to quiet it, and
      smoked and sang together.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;A frog he would a-wooing go,
          <i>Kitty alone, Kitty alone</i>,
     (Puff, puff.)
     A wonderful likely sort of a beau,
          <i>Kitty alone and I!</i>&rdquo;
      (<i>Puff, puff, puff</i>.)
</pre>
    <p>
      The sun was shining in at the doorway, and a man's shadow fell across the
      cradle-head. It was Philip. Pete put his mouth out into the form of an
      unspoken &ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; and Philip sat down in silence, while Pete went on with
      his smoke and his song.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;But when her husband rat came home,
          <i>Kitty alone, Kitty alone</i>,
     Pray who's been here since I've been gone?
          <i>Kitty alone and I!</i>&rdquo; <i>(Puff, Puff)</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      Pete had got to the middle of the verse about &ldquo;the worthy gentleman,&rdquo; when
      the low whine in the cradle lengthened to a long breath and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone off at last, God bless it,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;And how's yourself, Philip?
      And how goes the petition?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With his head on his hand, Philip was gazing absently into the fire, and
      he did not hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How goes the petition?&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was that I came to speak of,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;Sorry to say it has had no
      effect but a bad one. It has only drawn attention to the fact that Manx
      fishermen pay no harbour dues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And right too,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;The harbours are our fathers' harbours, and
      were freed to us forty years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;the dues are to be demanded. The Governor
      has issued an order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we'll rise against it&mdash;every fisherman in the island,&rdquo; said
      Pete. &ldquo;And when they're making you Dempster, you'll back us up in the
      Tynwald Coort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, Pete, take care,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Kate came in from church, and Pete welcomed her with a shout. Philip
      rose and bowed in silence. The marks of the prayers of the week were on
      her face, but they had brought her no comfort. She had been constantly
      promising herself consolation from religion, but every fresh exercise of
      devotion had seemed to tear open the wound from which she bled to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      She removed her cloak and stepped to the cradle. The child was sleeping
      peacefully, but she convinced herself that it must be unwell. Her own
      hands were cold and moist, and when she touched the child she thought its
      skin was clammy. Presently her hands became hot and dry, and when she
      touched the child again she thought its forehead was feverish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure she's ill,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chut! love,&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;no more ill than I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, to calm her fears, he went off for the doctor. The doctor was away in
      the country, and was not likely to be back for hours. Kate's fears
      increased. Every time she looked at the child she applied to it the
      symptoms of her own condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child is dying&mdash;I'm sure it is,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, darling,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Only an hour ago it was looking up as
      imperent as a tomtit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last a new terror seized her, and she cried, &ldquo;My child is dying
      unbaptized.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'll soon mend that, love,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;I'll be going off for the
      parson.&rdquo; And he caught up his hat and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called on Parson Quiggin, who promised to follow immediately. Then he
      went on to Sulby to fetch Cæsar and Grannie and some others, having no
      fear for the child's life, but some hope of banishing Kate's melancholy by
      the merriment of a christening feast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Philip and Kate were alone with the little one, save in the
      intervals of Nancy's coming and going between the hall and the kitchen.
      She was restless, and full of expectation, starting at every sound and
      every step. He could see that she had gone whole nights without sleep, and
      was passing through an existence that was burning itself away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do what he would to explain her sufferings as the common results of
      childbirth, he could not help resolving them in the old flattering
      solution. She was paying the penalty of having married the wrong man. And
      she was to blame. Whatever the compulsion put upon her, she ought to have
      withstood it. There was no situation in life from which it was not
      possible to escape. Had <i>he</i> not found a way out of a situation
      essentially the same? Thus a certain high pride in his own conduct took
      possession of him even in the presence of Kate's pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his tenderness fought with his self-righteousness. He looked at her
      piteous face and his strength almost ebbed away. She looked up into his
      eyes and affectionate pity almost overwhelmed him. Once or twice she
      seemed about to say something, but she did not speak, and he said little.
      Yet it wanted all his resolution not to take her in his arms and comfort
      her, not to mingle his tears with hers, not to tell her of six months
      spent in vain in the effort to wipe her out of his heart, not to whisper
      of cheerless days and of nights made desolate with the repetition of her
      name. But no, he would be stronger than that. It was not yet too late to
      walk the path of honour. He would stand no longer between husband and
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete came back, bringing Grannie and Cæsar. The parson arrived soon after
      them. Kate was sitting with the child in her lap, and brooding over it
      like a bird above its nest. The child was still sleeping the sleep of
      health and innocence, but the mother's eyes were wild.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bogh, bogh!&rdquo; said Grannie, and she kissed her daughter. Kate made no
      response. Nancy Joe grew red about the eyelids and began to blow her nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's the prazon, darling,&rdquo; whispered Pete, and Kate rose to her feet.
      The company rose with her, and stood in a half-circle before the fire. It
      was now between daylight and dark, and the firelight flashed in their
      faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the godfather and godmothers present?&rdquo; the parson asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Christian will stand godfather, parzon; and Nancy and Grannie will be
      godmothers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy took the child out of Kate's arms, and the service for private
      baptism began with the tremendous words, &ldquo;Dearly beloved, forasmuch as all
      men are conceived and born in si&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The parson stopped. Kate had staggered and almost fallen. Pete put his arm
      around her to keep her up, and then the service went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the parson turned to Philip with a softening voice and an
      inclination of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dost thou, in the name of this child, renounce the devil and all his
      works, the vain pomp and glory of the world, with all covetous desires of
      'the same, and the carnal desires of the flesh, so that thou wilt not
      follow nor be led by them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Philip answered, in a firm, low voice, &ldquo;I renounce them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The parson took the child from Nancy. &ldquo;Name this child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy looked at Kate, but Kate, who was breathing violently, gave no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate,&rdquo; whispered Pete; &ldquo;Kate, of coorse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Katherine,&rdquo; said Nancy, and in that name the child was baptized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Mylechreest came in as the service ended. Grannie held little
      Katherine up to him, and he controlled his face and looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's not much amiss with the child,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; shouted Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But perhaps the mother is a little weak and nervous,&rdquo; he added quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coorse she is, the bogh,&rdquo; cried Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her see more company,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shall,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that doesn't do, send her away for awhile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fresh scenes, fresh society; out of the island, by preference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm willing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll come back another woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll put up with the same one,&rdquo; said Pete; and, while the company
      laughed, he flung open the door, and cried &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; and half a dozen men
      who had been waiting outside trooped into the hall. They entered with shy
      looks because of the presence of great people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for a pull of jough, Nancy,&rdquo; cried Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too much excitement either,&rdquo; said the doctor, and with that warning
      he departed. The parson went with him. Philip had slipped out first,
      unawares to anybody. Grannie carried little Katherine to the kitchen, and
      bathed her before the fire. Kate was propped up with pillows in the
      armchair in the corner. Then Nancy brought the ale, and Pete welcomed it
      with a shout. Cæsar looked alarmed and rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The drink's your own, sir,&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;stop and taste it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Cæsar couldn't stay; it would scarcely be proper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't christen your first granddaughter every day,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Enjoy
      yourself while you're alive, sir; you'll be a long time dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar disappeared, but the rest of the company took Pete's counsel, and
      began to make themselves comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last christening I was at was yesterday,&rdquo; said John the Clerk. &ldquo;It
      was Christian Killip's little one, before she was married, and it took the
      water same as any other child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last christening I was at was my own,&rdquo; said Black Tom, &ldquo;when I was
      made an in inheriter, but I've never inherited yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's truth enough,&rdquo; said an asthmatic voice from the backstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the last christening I was at was at Kimberley,&rdquo; said Pete, &ldquo;and I
      was the parzon myself that day. Yes, though, Parzon Pete. And godfather
      and godmother as well, and the baby was Peter Quilliam, too. Aw, it was no
      laughing matter at all. There's always a truck of women about a compound,
      hanging on to the boys like burrs. Dirty little trousses of a rule, but
      human creatures for all. One of them had a child by somebody, and then she
      came to die, and couldn't take rest because it hadn't been christened.
      There wasn't a pazon for fifty miles, anywhere, and it was night-time,
      too, and the woman was stretched by the camp-fire and sinking. 'What's to
      be done?' says the men. <i>I'll</i> do it,' says I, and I did. One of the
      fellows got a breakfast can of water out of the river, and I dipped my
      hand in it. 'What's the name,' says I; but the poor soul was too far gone
      for spaking. So I gave the child my own name, though I didn't know the
      mother from Noah's aunt, and the big chaps standing round bareheaded began
      to blubber like babies. 'I baptize thee, Peter Quilliam, in the name of
      the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.' Then the girl
      died happy and aisy, and what for shouldn't she? The words were the same,
      and the water was the same, and if the hand wasn't as clane as usual,
      maybe Him that's above wouldn't bother about the diff'rance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate got up with a flush on her cheeks. The room had become too close.
      Pete helped her into the parlour, where a bright fire was burning, then
      propped and wrapped her up afresh, and, at her own entreaty, returned to
      his guests. The company had increased by this time, and there were women
      and girls among them. They went on to sing and to playt and at last to
      dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate heard them. Through the closed door between the hall and the parlour
      their merriment came to her. At intervals Pete put in his head, brimming
      over with laughter, and cried in a loud whisper, &ldquo;Did you hear that, Kate?
      It's rich!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At length Philip came, too, with his hat in one hand and a cardboard box
      in the other. &ldquo;The godfather's present to little Katherine,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate opened the lid, and drew out a child's hood in scarlet plush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good,&rdquo; she said vacantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let us talk of goodness,&rdquo; he answered; and he turned to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;I have something to say to you. Shut the door.&rdquo;

    <h3>
      Philip turned pale. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </h3>
    <p>
      She tried to speak, but at first she could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you unhappy, Kate?&rdquo; he faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you see?&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down by the fire, and leaned his face on his hands. &ldquo;Yes, we have
      both suffered,&rdquo; he said, in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you let me marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip raised his head. &ldquo;How could I have hindered you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? Do you ask me how?&rdquo; She spoke with some bitterness, but he answered
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried, Kate, but I could do nothing. You seemed determined. Do what I
      would to prevent, to delay, to stop your marriage altogether, the more you
      hastened and hurried it. Then I thought to myself, Well, perhaps it is
      best. She is trying to forget and forgive, and begin again. What right
      have I to stand in her way? Haven't I wronged her enough already? A good
      man offers her his love, and she is taking it. Let her do so, if she can,
      God help her! I may suffer, but I am nothing to her now. Let me go my
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her arms on the table, and hid her face in them. &ldquo;Oh, I cannot
      bear it,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose to his feet slowly. &ldquo;If it is my presence here that hurts you,
      Kate, I will go away. It has been but a painful pleasure to come, and I
      have been forced to take it. You will acquit me of coming of my own
      choice, Kate. But I will not torment you. I will go away, and never come
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her face, and said in a passionate whisper, &ldquo;Take me with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;That's impossible, Kate. You are married now. Your
      husband loves you dearly. He is a better man than I am, a thousand,
      thousand times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I don't know what he is?&rdquo; she cried, throwing herself back.
      &ldquo;That's why I can't live with him. It's killing me. I tell you I can't
      bear it,&rdquo; she cried, rising to her feet. &ldquo;Love me! Haven't I tried to make
      myself love <i>him</i>. Haven't I tried to be a good wife! I can't&mdash;I
      can't. He never speaks but he torments me. Nothing can happen but it cuts
      me through and through. I can't live in this house. The walls are crushing
      me, the ceiling is falling on me, the air is stifling me. I tell you I
      shall die if you do not take me out of it. Take me, Philip, take me, take
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught him by the arm imploringly, but he only dropped his head down
      between both hands, saying in a deep thick voice, &ldquo;Hush, Kate, hush! I
      cannot and I will not. You are mad to think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she sank down into the chair again, breathless and inert, and sobbing
      deep, low sobs. The sound of dancing came from the hall, with cries of
      &ldquo;Hooch!&rdquo; and the voice of Pete shouting&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Hit the floor with heel and toe
     'Till heaven help the boords below.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am mad, or soon will be,&rdquo; she said in a hard way. &ldquo;I thought of
      that this morning when I crossed the river coming home from church. It
      would soon be over <i>there</i>, I thought. No more trouble, no more
      dreams, no more waking in the night to hear the breathing of the one
      beside me, and the voice out of the darkness crying&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate, what are you saying?&rdquo; interrupted Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you needn't think I'm a bad woman because I ask you take me away from
      my husband. If I were that, I could brazen it out perhaps, and live on
      here, and pretend to forget; many a woman does, they say. And I'm not
      afraid that he will ever find me out either. I have only to close my lips,
      and he will never know. But <i>I</i> shall know, Philip Christian,&rdquo; she
      said, with a defiant look into his eyes as he raised them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her reproaches hurt him less than her piteous entreaties, and in a moment
      she was sobbing again. &ldquo;Oh, what can God do but let me die! I thought He
      would when the child came; but He did not, and then&mdash;am I a wicked
      woman, after all?&mdash;I prayed that He would take my innocent baby,
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she dashed the tears away in anger at her weakness, and said, &ldquo;I'm not
      a bad woman, Philip Christian; and that's why I won't live here any
      longer. There is something you have never guessed, and I have never told
      you; but I must tell you now, for I can keep my secret no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his head with a noise in his ears that was like the flapping of
      wings in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your secret, Kate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How happy I was,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Perhaps I was to blame&mdash;I loved you so,
      and was so fearful of losing you. Perhaps you thought of all that had
      passed between us as something that would go back and back as time went on
      and on. But it has been coming the other way ever since. Yes, and as long
      as I live and as long as the child lives&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice quivered like the string of a bow and stopped. He rose to his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The child, Kate? Did you say the child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer at once, and then she muttered, with her head down,
      &ldquo;Didn't I tell you there was something you had never guessed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it that?&rdquo; he said in a fearful whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure? You are not deceiving yourself? This is not hysteria?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that the child&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His questions had come in gasps, like short breakers out of a rising sea;
      her answers had fallen like the minute-gun above it. Then, in the silence,
      Pete's voice came through the wall. He was singing a rough old ditty&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;It was to Covent Gardens I chanced for to go,
     To see some of the prettiest flowers which in the gardens grow.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Nancy came in with a scuttle of coals. &ldquo;The lil one's asleep,&rdquo; she said,
      going down on her knees at the fire. She had left the door ajar, and
      Pete's song was rolling into the room&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;The first was lovely Nancy, so delicate and fair,
     The other was a vargin, and she did laurels wear.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grannie bathed her, and she's like a lil angel in the cot there,&rdquo; said
      Nancy. &ldquo;And, 'Dear heart alive, Grannie,' says I,' the straight she's like
      her father when she's sleeping.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy brushed the hearth and went off. As she closed the door, Pete's
      voice ebbed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip's lips trembled, his eyes wandered over the floor, he grew very
      pale, he tried to speak and could not. All his self-pride was overthrown
      in a moment The honour in which he had tried to stand erect as in a suit
      of armour was stripped away. Unwittingly he had been laying up an account
      with Nature. He had forgotten that a sin has consequences. Nature did not
      forget. She had kept her own reckoning. He had struggled to believe that
      after all he was a moral man, a free man; but Nature was a sterner
      moralist; she had chained him to the past, she had held him to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still by the fire with his head down. &ldquo;Did you know this before you
      were married to Pete?&rdquo; he asked, without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn't I wronged him enough without that?&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But did you think of it as something that might perhaps occur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I did, what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had told me, Kate, nothing and nobody should have come between us&mdash;no,&rdquo;
       he said in a decisive voice, &ldquo;not Pete nor all the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wasn't it your own duty to remember? Was it for me to come to you and
      say, 'Philip, something may happen, I am frightened.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was this the compulsion that had driven her into marriage with the wrong
      man? Was it all hysteria? Could she be sure? In any case she could not
      think this awful thought and continue to live with her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he said, with his head still down. &ldquo;You cannot live here
      any longer. This life of deception must end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will take me away, Philip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must, God forgive me, I must. I thought it would be sin. But <i>that</i>
      was long ago. It will be punishment. If I had known before&mdash;and I
      have been coming here time and again&mdash;looking on his happiness&mdash;but
      if I had once dreamt&mdash;and then only an hour ago&mdash;the oath at its
      baptism&mdash;O God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her tears were flowing again, but a sort of serenity had fallen on her
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I tried to keep it to myself&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not keep it; you ought never to have kept it so long; the
      finger of God Himself ought to have burnt it out of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke harshly, and she felt pain; but there was a secret joy as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ruining you, Philip,&rdquo; she said, leaning over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are both drifting to ruin, Katherine,&rdquo; he answered hoarsely. He was an
      abandoned hulk, with anchorage gone and no hand at the helm&mdash;broken,
      blind, rolling to destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can offer you nothing, Kate, nothing but a hidden life, a life in the
      dark. If you come to me you will leave a husband who worships you for one
      to whom your life can never be joined. You will exchange a life of respect
      by the side of a good man for a life of humiliation, a life of shame. How
      can it be otherwise now? It is too late, too late!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't think of that, Philip. If you love me there can be no humiliation
      and no shame for me in anything. I love you, dear, I cannot help but love
      you. Only love me a little, Philip, just a little, dearest, and I will
      never care&mdash;no, I will never, never care whatever happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her passionate devotion swept down all his scruples. His throat thickened,
      his eyes grew dim. She put one arm tenderly on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will follow you wherever you must go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are my real
      husband, Philip, and always have been. We will love one another, and that
      will make up for everything. There is nothing I will not do to make you
      forget. If you must go away&mdash;far away&mdash;no matter where&mdash;I
      will go with you&mdash;and the child as well&mdash;and if we must be poor,
      I'll work with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he did not seem to hear her as he crouched with buried face by the
      fire. And, in the silence, Pete's muffled voice came again through the
      wall, singing his rugged ditty&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;I'm not engaged to any young man, I solemnly do swear,
     For I mane to be a vargin and still the laurels wear.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Unconsciously their hands touched and their fingers intertwined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will break his heart,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She only grasped his hand the closer, and crouched beside him. They were
      like two guilty souls at the altar steps, listening to the cheerful bell
      that swings in the tower for the happy world outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened with a bang, and Pete rolled in, heaving with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you think it was an earth wake, Philip?&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;or a blackbird
      a bit tipsy, eh? Bless me, man, it's good of you, though, sitting up in
      the chimney there same as a good ould jackdaw, keeping the poor wife
      company when her selfish ould husband is flirting his tail like a
      stonechat. The company's going now, Kitty. Will they say good-night to
      you? No? Have it as you like, bogh. You're looking tired, anyway.
      Dempster, the boys are asking when the ceremony is coming off, and will
      you come home to Ramsey that night? But, sakes alive, man, your eye is
      splashed with blood as bad as the egg of a robin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his suffering and degradation, Philip felt as if he wished the earth to
      open and swallow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bloodshot, is it?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's nothing. The ceremony? I'm to take the
      oath to-morrow at three o'clock at the Special Council in Douglas. Yes,
      I'll come back to Ballure for the night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Driving, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six o'clock, maybe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps seven to eight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right. Mortal inquisitive the boys are, though. It's in the
      breed of these Manx ones, you know. Laxey way, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll drive by St. John's,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a look of wondrous wisdom, and a knowing wink at Kate across Philip's
      back, Pete went out. Then there was much talking in low tones in the hall,
      and on the paths outside the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip understood what it meant. He glanced back at the door, leaned over
      to Kate, and said in a whisper, without looking into her eyes&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The carriage shall come at half-past seven. It will stand for a moment in
      the Parsonage Lane, and then drive back to Douglas by way of Laxey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face was broken and ugly with shame and humiliation. As she saw this
      she thought of her confession, and it seemed odious to her now; but there
      was an immense relief in the feeling that the crisis was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete was shouting at the porch, &ldquo;Good-night, all! Goodnight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo; came back in many voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grannie came in muffled up to the throat. &ldquo;However am I to get back to
      Sulby, and your father gone these two hours?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not him,&rdquo; said Pete, coming behind with one eye screwed up and a finger
      to his nose. &ldquo;The ould man's been on the back-stairs all night, listening
      and watching wonderful. His bark's tremenjous, but his bite isn't worth
      mentioning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then a plaintive voice came from the hall, saying, &ldquo;Are you <i>never</i>
      coming home, mother? I'm worn out waiting for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little patch of youth had blossomed in Grannie since the baby came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Pete,&rdquo; she cried from the gate, &ldquo;and many happy returns of
      the christening-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One was enough for yourself, mother,&rdquo; said Cæsar, and then his voice went
      rumbling down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip had come out into the hall. &ldquo;You're time enough yet,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;A
      glass first? No? I've sent over to the 'Mitre' for your mare. There she
      is; that's her foot on the path. I must be seeing you off, anyway. Where's
      that lantern, at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stepped out. Pete held the light while Philip mounted, and then he
      guided him, under the deep shadow of the old tree, to the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine night for a ride, Phil. Listen! That's the churning of the nightjar
      going up to Ballure glen. Well, good-night! Good-night, and God bless you,
      old fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate inside heard the deadened sound of Philip's &ldquo;Goodnight,&rdquo; the crunch
      of the mare's hoofs on the gravel and the clink of the bit in her teeth.
      Then the porch door closed with a hollow vibration like that of a vault,
      the chain rattled across it, and Pete was back in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What</i> a night we've had of it! And now to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2H_4_0077" id="link2H_4_0077">

    <h2>
      XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kate was up early the next morning, but Pete was stirring before her. As
      soon as he had heard the news of Philip's appointment he had organised a
      drum and brass band to honour the day of the ceremony. The brass had been
      borrowed from Laxey, but the drum had been bought by Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's have a good sizable drum,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;something with a voice in it,
      not a bit of a toot, going off with a pop like bladder-wrack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The parchment was three feet across, the steel rings round it were like
      the hoops of a dog-cart, and the black drumsticks, according to Pete, were
      like the bullet heads of two niggers. Jonaique Jelly played the clarionet,
      and John the Widow played the trombone, but the drum was the leading
      instrument. Pete himself played it. He pounded it, boomed it, thundered
      it. While he did so, his eyes blazed with rapture. A big heroic soul spoke
      out of the drum for Pete. With the strap over his shoulders, he did not
      trouble much about the tune. When the heart Leapt inside his breast, down
      came the nigger heads on to the mighty protuberance in front of it; and
      surely that was the end and aim of all music.
    </p>
    <p>
      The band practised in the cabin which Pete had set up for a summer-house
      in the middle of his garden. They met at daybreak that morning for the
      last of their rehearsals. And, being up before their morning meal, they
      were constrained to smoke and drink as well as play. This they did out of
      a single pipe and a single pot, which each took up from the table in turn
      as it fell to his part to have a few bars' rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      While their muffled melody came to the house through the wooden walls and
      the dense smoke, Kate was cooking breakfast. She did everything carefully,
      for she was calmer than usual, and felt relieved of the load that had
      oppressed her. But once she leaned her head on the mantelshelf while
      stooping over the frying-pan, and looked vacantly into the fire; and once
      she raised herself up from the table-cloth at the sound of the drum, and
      pressed her hand hard on her brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child awoke in the bedroom above and cried. Nancy Joe went
      flip-flapping upstairs, and brought her down with much clucking and
      cackling. Kate took the child and fed her from a feeding-bottle which had
      been warming on the oven top. She was very tender with the little one,
      kissing all its extremities in the way that women have, worrying its legs,
      and putting its feet into her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete came in, hot and perspiring, and Kate handed the child back to Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hould hard,&rdquo; cried Pete; &ldquo;don't take her off yet. Give me a hould of her,
      the lil rogue. My sailor! What a child it is, though! Look at that, now.
      She's got a grip of my thumb. What a fist, to be sure! It's lying in my
      hand like a meg. Did you stick a piece of dough on the wall at your last
      baking, Nancy? Just as well to keep the evil eye off. Coo&mdash;oo&mdash;oo!
      She's going it reg'lar, same as the tide of a summer's day. By jing,
      Kitty, I didn't think there was so much fun in babies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate, seated at the table, was pouring out the tea, and a sudden impulse
      seized her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the way,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;First the wife is everything; but the child
      comes, and then good-bye to the mother who brought it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by gough!&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;The child is eighteen carat goold for the
      mother's sake, but the mother is di'monds for sake of the child. If I lost
      that little one, Kitty, it would be like losing the half of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Losing, indeed!&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;Who's talking about losing? Does she look
      like it, bless her lil heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take her into the kitchen, Nancy,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to have a rare do to-day,&rdquo; said Pete, over a mouthful. &ldquo;I'm off for
      Douglas, to see Philip made Dempster. Coming home with himself by way of
      St. John's. It's all arranged, woman. Boys to meet the carriage by Kirk
      Christ Lezayre at seven o'clock smart. Then out I'm getting, laying hould
      of the drum, the band is striking up, and we're bringing him into Ramsey
      triumphant. Oh, we'll be doing it grand,&rdquo; said Pete, blowing over the rim
      of his saucer. &ldquo;John the Clerk is tremenjous on the trombones, and there's
      no bating Jonaique with the clar'net&mdash;the man is music to his little
      backbone. The town will be coming out too, and the fishermen shouting like
      one man. We're bound to let the Governor see we mane it. A friend's a
      friend, say I, and we're for bucking up for the man that's bucking up for
      us. And when he goes to the Tynwald Coort there, it'll be lockjaw and the
      measles with some of them. If the ould Governor's got a tongue like a
      file, Philip's got a tongue like a scythe&mdash;he'll mow them down. 'No
      harbour-dues,' says he, 'till we've a raisonable hope of harbour
      improvements. Build your embankments for your trippers in Douglas if you
      like, but don't ask the fisher-, men to pay for them.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete wiped his mouth and charged his pipe. &ldquo;It'll be a rare ould dust, but
      we're not thinking of ourselves only, though. Aw, no, no. If there wasn't
      nothing doing we would be giving him a little tune for all, coming home
      Dempster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete lit up. &ldquo;My sailor! It'll be a proud man I'll be this day, Kitty.
      Didn't I always say it? 'He'll be the first Manxman living,' says I times
      and times, and he's not going to de-ceave me neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate was in fear lest Pete should look up into her face. Catching sight of
      a rent in the cloth of his coat, she whipped out her needle and began to
      stitch it up, bending closely over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an eye a woman's got now,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;That was the steel of the
      drum ragging me sideways when I was a bit excited. Bless me, Kitty, there
      won't be a rag left at me when I get through this everin'. They're ter'ble
      on clothes is drums.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was puffing the smoke through her hair as she knelt below him. &ldquo;Well,
      he deserves it all. My sakes, the years I've known him! Him and me have
      been same as brothers. Yes, have we, ever since I was a slip of a boy in
      jackets, and we went nesting on Maughold Head together. And getting
      married hasn't been making no difference. When a man marries he shortens
      sail usually, and pitches out some ballast, but not me at all. You're
      taking a chill, Kitty. No? Shuddering any way. Chut! This dress is like
      paper; you should be having warmer things under it. Don't be going out
      to-day, darling, but to-night, about twenty-five minutes better than
      seven, just open the door and listen. We'll be agate of it then like mad,
      and when you're hearing the drum booming you'll be saying to yourself,
      'Pete's there, and going it for all he knows.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Pete, Pete!&rdquo; cried Kate, and she dropped back at his feet
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what's this at all?&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been very, very good to me, Pete, and if I never see you again
      you'll think the best of me, will you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had an impulse to tell all&mdash;she could hardly resist it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smoothed the black ripples of her hair back from her forehead, and
      said, tenderly, &ldquo;She's not so well to-day, that's it. Her eyes are
      bubbling like the laver.&rdquo; Then aloud, with a laugh, &ldquo;Never see me again,
      eh? I'm not willing to share you with heaven yet, though. But I'll have to
      be doing as the doctor was saying&mdash;sending you to England aver. I
      will now, I will,&rdquo; he said, lifting his big finger threateningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slid backwards to the ground, but at the next moment was landed on
      Pete's breast. &ldquo;My poor lil Kirry! Not willing to stay with me, eh? Tut,
      tut! She'll be as smart as ever, soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew away from him with shame and self-reproach, mingled with that old
      feeling of personal repulsion which she could not conquer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the gate of the garden clicked, and Ross Christian came up the path.
      &ldquo;He's sticking to me as tight as a limpet,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Quilliam,&rdquo; said Ross, &ldquo;I come from my father this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Deed, man,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a little pressed for money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mr. Peter Christian sends to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thought you might like to lend on mortgage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Ballawhaine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ross stammered and stuttered, &ldquo;Well, yes, certainly, as you say, on Balla&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think, to think,&rdquo; muttered Pete. He gazed vacantly before him for a
      moment, and then said, sharply, &ldquo;I've no time to talk of it now, sir. I'm
      off to Douglas, but if you like to stop awhile and talk of it with Mrs.
      Quilliam, I'll be hearing everything when I come back. Good-day, Kate.
      Take care of my wife. Good-day, Nancy; look after my two girls while I'm
      away. And Kitty, bogh&rdquo; (whispering), &ldquo;mind you send to Robbie Clucas, the
      draper, for some nice warm underclothing. Good-bye! Another! Just one
      more&rdquo; (then aloud) &ldquo;Good-day to you, sir, good-day.&rdquo;

      XIII.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;... He, the Spirit Himself, may come
     When all the nerve of sense is numb.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Philip had not slept at Ballure. The house was in darkness as he passed.
      He was riding to Douglas. It is sixteen miles between town and town, six
      of them over the steep headland of Kirk Maughold. Before he reached the
      top of the ascent he had been an hour on the road, and the night was near
      to morning. He had seen no one after leaving Ramsey, except a drunken
      miner with his bundle on his stick, marching home to a tipsy travesty of
      some brave song.
    </p>
    <p>
      His self-righteousness was overthrown; his pride was in the dust. Since he
      returned home, he had struggled to feel strong and easy in the sense of
      being an honourable man; but now he was thrown violently out of the path
      in which he had meant to walk rightly. What he was about to do was
      necessary, was inevitable, yet in his relation to Kate he was in the
      position of an immoral man, a betrayer, an adulterer, with a vulgar
      secret, which he must support by lying and share with servants. And what
      was the outlook? What would be the end? Here was a situation from which
      there was no escape. Let there be no false glamour, no disguise, no
      self-deception. On the eve of his promotion to the dignities and
      responsibilities of a Judge, he was taking the first step down on the
      course of the criminal!
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon was shining at the full. It was low down in the sky, on his
      right, and casting his shadow on to the road. He walked his horse up the
      long hill. The even pace, the quiet of the night, the drowsy sounds of
      unseen stream and far-off murmuring sea overcame him in spite of himself,
      and he dozed in the saddle. As he reached the hilltop the level step of
      the horse awoke him, and he knew that he was passing that desolate spot on
      the border of parish and parish which is known as Tom Alone's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opening his eyes, without realising that he had slept, he thought he
      became aware of another horse and another rider walking by his side. They
      were on the left of him, going pace for pace, stepping along with him like
      his shadow. &ldquo;It <i>is</i> my shadow,&rdquo; he thought, and he forced up his
      head to look. Nothing was there but a whitewashed wall that fenced a
      sheepfold. The moon had gone under the mountains on the right, and the
      night would have been dark but for the stars. With an astonishment near to
      terror, Philip gripped the saddle with his quaking knees, and broke his
      horse into a trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the hard ride had brought warmth to his blood and a glow to his
      cheeks, he told himself he had been the victim of fancy. It was nothing;
      it was a delusion of the sight; a mere shadow cast off by his distempered
      brain. He was passing at a walking pace through Laxey by this time, and as
      the horse's feet beat up the echoes of the sleeping town, his heart grew
      brave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, at noon, he was talking with his servant, Jem-y-Lord, in his
      rooms in Athol Street. He had lately become tenant of the entire house.
      They were in his old chambers on the first floor, looking on to the
      churchyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may rely on you, Jemmy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may, Deemster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice was low and husky, his eyes were down, he was fumbling the
      papers on the table. &ldquo;Get the carriage, a landau, from Shimmin's, but
      drive it yourself. Be at Government offices at four&mdash;we'll go by St.
      John's. If there is any attempt at Ramsey to take the horse out of the
      carriage, resist it. I will alight at the head of the town. Then drive on
      to the lane between the chapel and Elm Cottage. The moment the lady joins
      you, start away. Return to Laxey&mdash;are the rooms upstairs ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two in front of your own, and the little parlour behind this. We
      shall need no other servants&mdash;the lady will be housekeeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite understand, Deemster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip turned his face aside and spoke thickly, &ldquo;And you know what name&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what name, Deemster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no objection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever, Deemster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phillip drew a long breath. &ldquo;I am not Deemster yet, Jemmy. Perhaps it
      might have been... but God knows. You are a good fellow&mdash;I shall not
      forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a motion as if to dismiss the man, but Jemmy did not go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, your honor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your honour has eaten nothing at breakfast&mdash;and the bed wasn't slept
      in last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was riding late&mdash;then I had work to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I heard your foot on the floor&mdash;-it woke me times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may have speeches to make to-day.... Fetch me a glass of water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jemmy brought water-bottle and glass. As Philip took the water an icy
      numbness seemed to seize his arm. &ldquo;I&mdash;well, I&mdash;I declare I can't
      lift&mdash;ah! thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man raised Philip's arm to his mouth; the glass rattled against his
      teeth while he drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, your honour. You're looking ten years older lately. The sooner
      this day is over the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep, Jemmy&mdash;I only want sleep. I must have a long, long sleep at
      Ballure to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the house at three minutes to three, carrying his cloak over his
      arm. It was a hot day at the beginning of June, and when he stepped out at
      the door the air of the street smote his face like a blast from an open
      furnace. He reeled and almost fell. The sun's heat was like a load on his
      head, its dazzling rays made his sight dim, and he had a sound in his ears
      like running water. As he walked down the street he caught his wandering
      reflection in the shop windows. &ldquo;Jemmy was right,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;My worst
      enemy would not accuse me of looking too young to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a small crowd about the entrance to Government offices.
      Carriages were driving up, discharging their occupants and going on. The
      Bishop, the Attorney-General, finally the Governor with his wife and
      daughter passed into the house. In the commotion of these arrivals Philip
      reached the door unobserved. When he was recognised, there was a sudden
      hush of voices, and then a low buzz of gossip. He walked through with a
      firm step, going in alone, all eyes upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doorway opens on a narrow passage, which is neither wide nor very
      light, and the sunshine without made the gloom within more grey and
      uncertain. As Philip stepped over the threshold he was conscious that
      somebody was coming out. When he had taken two paces more, he drew up
      sharply with the sense of walking into a mirror. At the next instant he
      saw that what he had taken for the reflection of his own face in a glass
      was the actual face of another man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was coming out as he went in. They were approaching each other. At
      two paces more they were side by side. He looked at the man with creeping
      horror. The man looked at him with amazement and dread. Thus, eye to eye,
      they crossed and passed. Then each turned his head over his shoulder and
      looked after the other, Philip stepping into the gloom, the stranger
      striding into the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the next moment the narrow doorway was darkened by a ponderous figure
      rolling through. Then a heavy hand fell on Philip's shoulder, and a hearty
      voice exclaimed, &ldquo;Hilloa, Christian; proud to see you, boy! You've
      outstripped old stick-in-the-mud; but I always knew you would lead me the
      way though.... Funking a bit, are you? Hands like ice, anyway. Come along&mdash;nothing
      to be nervous about&mdash;we're not going to give you the dose of Illiam
      Dhone&mdash;-don't martyr the Christians these days, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Is was Philip's old master, the Clerk of the Rolls. Taking Philip's arm,
      he was for swinging him along; but Philip, still looking towards the
      street, said falteringly, &ldquo;Did you, perhaps, see a man&mdash;a young man&mdash;going
      out at the door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you came in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there?&rdquo; said the Clerk dubiously; then, as by a sudden light, &ldquo;Did he
      wear a round hat and a monkey-jacket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe&mdash;I hardly know&mdash;I didn't observe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll be the man. He's been at me half the morning for admission to the
      Council. Said he'd known you all his life. Bough as a thorn-bush, but
      somehow I couldn't say no to the fellow at last. He ought to be inside,
      though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's nothing,&rdquo; thought Philip. &ldquo;Only another shadow from a tired brain.
      Jemmy's talk about my altered looks&mdash;the reflection in the
      shop-windows&mdash;the sudden gloom after the dazzling sunlight&mdash;that's
      all, that's all. Sleep, I want sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Governor took his seat with the first Deemster on his right, and
      motioned Philip to the chair on his left, an involuntary murmur passed
      over the chamber at the contrast there presented&mdash;the one Deemster
      very old, with round, russet face, quick, gleaming eyes, and a
      comfortable, youthful, even merry expression; the other, very young, with
      long, pallid, powerful face, large eyes, and a tired look of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip presented his commission received from the Home Secretary, and the
      oath of office was administered to him. Kissing a stained copy of a
      leather-bound Testament, he repeated the words after the Governor in a
      thick croak that seemed to hack the air&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this book, and by the holy contents thereof, and by the wonderful
      works that God hath miraculously wrought in heaven above and on the earth
      beneath in six days and seven nights, I, Philip Christian, do swear that I
      will, without respect of favour or friendship, love or hate, loss or gain,
      consanguinity or affinity, envy or malice, execute the laws of this Isle
      justly, betwixt our Sovereign Lady the Queen and her subjects within this
      Isle, and betwixt party and party, as indifferently as the herring
      backbone doth lie in the midst of the fish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Philip pronounced these words, he was conscious of only one face in
      that assembly. It was not the face of the Governor, of the Bishop, of any
      dignitary of Church or State&mdash;but a rugged, eager, dark face over a
      black beard in the grip of a great brown hand, with sparkling eyes, parted
      lips, and a look of boyish pride&mdash;it was the face of Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It only remains for me,&rdquo; said the Governor, &ldquo;to congratulate your Honour
      on the high office to which it has pleased Her Majesty to appoint you, and
      to wish you long life and health to fulfil its duties, with blameless
      credit to yourself and distinction to your country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was some other speaking, and then Philip replied. He spoke clearly,
      firmly, and well. A reference to his grandfather provoked applause. His
      modesty and natural manner made a strong impression. &ldquo;His Excellency is
      not so far wrong, after all,&rdquo; was the common whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some further business, and the Council broke up for general gossip. Then,
      on the pavement outside, while the carriages were coming in line, there
      were renewed congratulations, invitations, and warnings. The Governor
      invited Philip to dinner. He excused himself, saying he had promised to
      dine with his aunt at Ballure. The ladies warned him to spare himself, and
      recommended a holiday; and then the Clerk of the Rolls, proud as a
      peacock, strutting here and there and everywhere, and assuming the airs of
      a guardian, cried, &ldquo;Can't yet, though, for he holds his first court in
      Ramsey tomorrow morning.... Put on the cloak, Christian. It will be cold
      driving. Good men are scarce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An open landau came up at length, with Jem-y-Lord on the box-seat, and
      Pete walking by the horse's head, smoothing its neck and tickling its
      ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you were talking of the young man, Christian, and behold ye, here's
      the great fellow himself. Well, young chap,&rdquo; slapping Pete on the back,
      &ldquo;see your Deemster take the oath, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's my cousin,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin! Is he, then&mdash;can he perhaps be&mdash;Ah! yes, of course,
      certainly&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The good man stammered and stopped,
      remembering the marriage of Philip's father. He opened the carriage door
      and stood aside for Philip, but Philip said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Step in, Pete;&rdquo; and, with a shamefaced look, Pete rolled into the
      carriage. Philip took the seat beside him, amid a buzz of voices from the
      people standing about the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as you like; good day, then, boy, good day,&rdquo; said the Clerk of the
      Rolls, clashing the door back. The carriage began to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day, your Honour,&rdquo; cried several out of the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip raised his hat. The hats of the men went up to him. Some of the
      girls were wiping their eyes.

    <h2>
      XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While Pete and Philip were driving over the road from Douglas, Kate was
      sitting with the child on her lap before the fire in Elm Cottage. Her eyes
      were restless, her manner agitated. She looked out at the window from time
      to time. The setting sun behind the house still held the day with
      horizontal shafts of light in the spring green of the transparent leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't you like to see the procession to-night, Nancy?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, mortal,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;But I won't get lave, though. 'Take care of my
      two girls,' says he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may go, Nancy; I'll see to baby,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the man himself, woman; he'll be coming home as hungry as a hunter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see to his supper, too,&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;Carry the key with you that you
      may let yourself in, and be back at half-past seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Nancy began to fly about the kitchen like sputter-ings out of the
      frying-pan&mdash;filling the kettle, lighting the lamp, and getting
      together the baby's night-clothes. Kate watched her and glanced at the
      clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the town quiet when you were out for the bacon, Nancy?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quiet enough,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;Everybody flying off Le-zayre way already&mdash;except
      what were making for the quay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the steamer sailing to-night, then?''
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the <i>Peveril</i>; but not water enough to float her till half-past
      seven, they were saying. Here's the lil one's nightdress, and here's her
      binder, bless her&mdash;just big enough for a bandage for a person's wrist
      if she sprained it churning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lay them on the fender to air, Nancy&mdash;I'll not undress baby yet
      awhile. And see&mdash;it's nearly seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be pinning my shawl on and away like the wind,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;The
      bogh!&rdquo; she said, with the pin between her teeth. &ldquo;She's off again. Do you
      really think, now, the angels in heaven are as sweet and innocent, Kirry?
      I don't. They can't if they're grown up. And having to climb Jacob's
      ladder, poor things, they must be. Then, if they're men&mdash;but that's
      ridiculous, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The clock is striking, Nancy. No use going when everything's over,&rdquo; said
      Kate, and the foot with which she rocked the child went faster now that
      the little one was asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sakes alive! Let me tie the strings of my bonnet, woman. Pity you can't
      come yourself, Kitty. But if they're worth their salt they'll be whipping
      round this way and giving you a lil tune, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got the key, Nancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I'll be back in an hour. And mind you put baby to bed soon, and
      mind you&mdash;and mind you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With as many warnings as if she had been mistress and Kate the servant,
      Nancy backed herself out of the house. It was now dark outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate rose immediately, put the child in the cradle, and began to lay the
      table for Pete's supper&mdash;the cruet, the plates, the teapot on the hob
      to warm, and then&mdash;by force of habit&mdash;two cups and saucers. But
      sight of the cups awakened her to painful consciousness. She put one of
      them back in the cupboard, broke the coal on the fire, settled the kettle
      up to the blaze, fixed the Dutch oven with three rashers of bacon before
      the bars, then lit a candle, and, with a nervous look around, turned to go
      upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the bedroom she drew on her cloak, pinned her hat and veil with
      trembling fingers, then took her purse from her pocket and emptied its
      contents onto the dressing-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not mine,&rdquo; she thought. And standing before the mirror at that moment,
      she caught sight of her earrings. &ldquo;I must take nothing of his,&rdquo; she told
      herself, and she raised her hands to her ears. Then her heart smote her.
      &ldquo;As if Pete would ever think of such things,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;No, not if I
      took everything he has in the world. And must <i>I</i> be thinking of
      them?... Yet I cannot&mdash;I will not take them with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened a drawer and hurried everything into it&mdash;the money, the
      earrings, the keeper off her finger, and then she paused at the touch of
      the wedding-ring. A superstitious instinct restrained her. Yet the ring
      was the badge of her broken covenant. &ldquo;With this ring I thee wed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       She tore off the wedding-ring also, and cast it with the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will find them,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;There will be nothing else to tell him
      what has happened. He will come, and I shall be gone. He will call, and
      there will be no answer. He will look for me, and I shall be lost to him
      for ever. Not a word left behind. Not a line to say, 'Thank you and
      good-bye and God bless you, dear Pete, for all your love and goodness to
      rae.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was cruel&mdash;very cruel&mdash;yet what could she write? What could
      she say that had not better be left unsaid? The least syllable&mdash;no,
      the uncertainty would be kinder. Perhaps Pete would think she was dead&mdash;perhaps
      that she had destroyed herself. Even that would not be so bitter as the
      truth. He would get over it&mdash;he would become reconciled. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she
      thought, &ldquo;I can write nothing&mdash;I can leave no message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shut the drawer quickly, and picked up the candle. As she did so, the
      shadow of herself moved about her. It mounted from the floor to the wall,
      from the wall to the ceiling. When she walked it seemed to be on top of
      her, hanging over her, pressing down on her, crushing her. She grew cold
      and sick, and hastened to the door. The room was full of other shadows&mdash;the
      memories of sleepless nights and of painful awakenings. These stared at
      her from every familiar thing&mdash;the watch ticking in its stand on the
      mantelpiece, the handle of the wardrobe, the pink curtains of the bed, the
      white pillow beneath them. She felt like a frightened child. With a
      terrified glance over her shoulder she crept out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being downstairs again, she breathed more freely. There was light all
      about her, and the hall-parlour was bright and warm. The kettle was now
      singing in the cheerful blaze, the cat was purring on the rug, and there
      was a smell of bacon slowly frying. She looked at the clock&mdash;it was a
      quarter after seven. &ldquo;Time to waken baby,&rdquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took from a chest the child's outdoor clothes&mdash;a robe, a pelisse,
      and a white hood. Her fingers had touched a scarlet hood in a cardboard
      box, but &ldquo;not that&rdquo; she thought, and left it. She spread the clothes about
      her chair, and then lifted the little one from the cradle to her pillowing
      arm. The child awoke as she raised it, and made a fretful cry, which she
      smothered in a gurgling kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can love the darling without shame now,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;It's sweet face
      will reproach me no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With soft cooings at the baby's cheek, she was stooping to take the robe
      that lay at her feet, when her eyes fell on the round place in the cradle
      where the child had been. That made her think again of Pete. He would come
      home and find the little nest cold and empty. It would kill him; it would
      be a second bereavement. Was it not enough that she should go away
      herself? Must she rob him of the child as well? He loved it; he doted on
      it. It was the light of his eyes, the joy of his life. To lose it would be
      a blow like the blow of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet could a mother leave her child behind her? Impossible! The full tide
      of motherhood came over her, and its tender selfishness swept down
      everything. &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;come what may, I cannot and I will
      not leave her.&rdquo; And then she reached her hand for the child's pelisse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a kind of atonement, though,&rdquo; she thought. To leave the
      little one to Pete would be making amends in some sort for the wrong that
      she was doing him. To deny herself the sight of the child's sweet face day
      by day and hour by hour&mdash;that would be a punishment also, and she
      deserved to be punished. &ldquo;Can I leave her?&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Can I? Oh, what
      mother could bear it? No, no&mdash;never, never! And yet I ought&mdash;I
      must&mdash;Oh, this is terrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this agony of uncertainty, thinking of Pete and of the
      wrong she had done him, yet pressing the child to her breast with
      trembling arms, as if some one were tearing it away, the babe itself
      settled everything. Making some inarticulate whimper of communication, it
      nuzzled up to her, its eyes closed, but its head working against her bosom
      with the instinct of suckling, though it had never sucked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm only half a mother, after all,&rdquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The highest joys, the deepest rights of motherhood had been denied to her&mdash;the
      child taking from the mother, the mother giving to the child, the child
      and the mother one&mdash;: this had not been hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My little baby can live without me,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;If I leave her, she
      will never miss me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nearly broke down at that thought, and almost let her purpose slip. It
      was like God's punishment in advance, God's hand directing her&mdash;thus
      to withdraw the child from dependence on herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I must leave her with Pete,&rdquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put the child back into the cradle, half dressed as it was, and rocked
      it until it slept again. Then she hung over the tiny bed as a mother hangs
      over the little coffin that is soon to be shut up from her eyes for ever.
      Her tears rained down on the small counterpane. &ldquo;My sweet baby I my little
      Katherine! I may never kiss you again&mdash;never see you any more'&mdash;you
      may grow up to be a woman and know nothing of your mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clock ticked loud in the quiet room&mdash;it was twenty-five minutes
      past seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One kiss more, my little darling. If they ever tell you... they'll say
      because your mother left you... Oh, will she think I did not love her?
      Hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the walls of the house there came the sound of a band playing at a
      distance. She looked at the clock again&mdash;it was nearly half-past
      seven. Almost at the same moment there was the rumble of carriage-wheels
      on the road. They stopped in the lane that ran between the chapel and the
      end of the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate rose from her knees and opened the door softly. The house had been as
      a dungeon to her, and she was flying from it like a prisoner escaping. A
      shrill whistle pierced the air. The <i>Peveril</i> was leaving the quay.
      Through the streets there was a sound as of water running over stones. It
      was the scuttling of the feet of the townspeople as they ran to meet the
      procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stepped out. The garden was dark and quiet as a prison yard; Hardly a
      leaf stirred, but the moon was breaking through the old fir-tree as she
      lifted her troubled face to the untroubled sky. She stood and listened.
      The band was coming nearer. She could hear the thud of the big drum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boom! Boom! Boom!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete was there. He was helping at Philip's triumph. That was the beat of
      his great heart made audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this her own heart stopped for a moment. She grew chill at the thought
      of the brave man who asked no better lot than to love and cherish her, and
      at the memory of the other upon whose mercy she had cast herself. The band
      stopped. There was a noise like the breaking of a mighty rocket in the
      sky. The people were cheering and clapping hands. Then a clearer sound
      struck her ear. It was the clock inside the house chiming the half-hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy would be back soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate listened intently, inclining her head inwards. If the child had
      awakened at that instant, if it had stirred and cried, she must have gone
      back for good. She returned for one moment and flung herself over the
      cradle again. One spasm more of lingering tenderness. &ldquo;Good-bye, my little
      one! I am leaving you with him, darling, because he loves you dearly. You
      will grow up and be a good, good girl to him always. Good-bye, my pet! My
      precious, my precious! You will reward him for all he has done for me. You
      are half of myself, dearest&mdash;the innocent half. Yes, you will wipe
      out your mother's sin. You will be all he thinks I am, but never have
      been. Farewell, my sweet Katherine, my little, darling baby&mdash;good-bye&mdash;farewell&mdash;good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leapt up and fled out of the house at last, on tiptoe, like a thief,
      pulling the door after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she heard the click of the lock she felt both wretchedness and
      exultation&mdash;immense agony and immense relief. If little Katherine
      were to cry now, she could not return to her. The door was closed, the
      house was shut, the prison was left behind. And behind her, too, were the
      treachery, the duplicity, and deceit of ten stifling months.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurried through the garden to a side-door in the wall leading to the
      lane. The path was like a wave of the sea to her stumbling feet. Her
      breathing was short, her sight was weak, her temples were beating audibly.
      Half across the garden something touched her dress, and she made a faint
      scream. It was Pete's dog, Dempster. He was looking up at her out of the
      darkness of the bushes. By the light through the blind of the house she
      could see his bat's ears and watchful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boom! Boom! Boom!
    </p>
    <p>
      The band had begun again. It was coming nearer. Philip! Philip! He was her
      only refuge now. All else was a blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The side-door had been little used. Its hinges and bolt were rusty and
      stiff. She broke her nails in opening it. From the other side came the
      light jingle of a curb chain, and over the wall hovered a white sheet of
      smoking light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage was in the lane, and the driver&mdash;Philip's servant,
      Jem-y-Lord&mdash;stood with the door open. Kate stumbled on the step and
      fell into the seat. The door was closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a new thought smote her. It was about the child, about Philip, about
      Pete. In leaving the little one behind her, though she had meant it so
      unselfishly, she had done the one thing that must be big with
      consequences. It would bring its penalty, its punishment, its retribution.
      Stop! She would go back even yet. Her face was against the glass; she was
      struggling with the strap. But the carriage was moving. She heard the
      rumble of the wheels; it was like a deafening reverberation from the day
      of doom. Then her senses dwaled away and the carriage drove on.

    <h2>
      XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Outside Ballure House there was a crowd which covered the garden, the
      fence, the high-road, and the top of the stone wall opposite. The band had
      ceased to play, and the people were shouting, clapping hands, and
      cheering. At the door&mdash;which was open&mdash;Philip stood bareheaded,
      and a shaft of the light in the house behind him lit up a hundred of the
      eager faces gathered in the darkness. He raised his hand for silence, but
      it was long before he was allowed to speak. Salutations rugged, rough&mdash;almost
      rude&mdash;but hearty to the point of homeliness, and affectionate to the
      length of familiarity, flew at his head from every side. &ldquo;Good luck to
      you, boy!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Bravo for Ramsey!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The Christians for your life!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;A
      chip of the ould block&mdash;Dempster Christian the Sixth!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hush,
      man, he's spaking!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Go it, Phil!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Give it fits, boy!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hush!
      hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fellow-townsmen,&rdquo; said Philip&mdash;his voice swung like a quivering bell
      over a sea,&mdash;&ldquo;you can never know how much your welcome has moved me.
      I cannot say whether in my heart of hearts I am more proud of it or more
      ashamed. To be ashamed of it altogether would dishonour <i>you</i>, and to
      be too proud of it would dishonour <i>me</i>, I am not worthy of your
      faith and good-fellowship. Ah!&rdquo;&mdash;he raised his hand to check a murmur
      of dissent (the crowd was now hushed from end to end)&mdash;&ldquo;let me utter
      the thought of all. In honouring me you are thinking of others also ('No,'
      'Yes'); you are thinking of my people&mdash;above all, of one who was laid
      under the willows yonder, a wrecked, a broken, a disappointed man&mdash;my
      father, God rest him! I will not conceal it from you&mdash;his memory has
      been my guide, his failures have been my lightship, his hopes my beacon,
      his love my star. For good or for evil, my anchor has been in the depths
      of his grave. God forbid that I should have lived too long under the grasp
      of a dead hand. It was my aim to regain what he had lost, and this day has
      witnessed its partial reclamation. God grant I may not have paid too dear
      for such success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were cries of &ldquo;No, sir, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled faintly and shook his head. &ldquo;Fellow-countrymen, you believe I am
      worthy of the name I bear. There is one among you, an old comrade, a tried
      and trusted friend, whose faith would be a spur if it were not a reproach&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice was breaking, but still it pealed over the sea of heads. &ldquo;Well,
      I will try to do my duty&mdash;from this hour onwards you shall see me
      try. Fellow-Manxmen, you will help me for the honour of the place I fill,
      for the sake of our little island, and&mdash;yes, and for my own sake
      also, I know you will&mdash;to be a good man and an upright judge. But&rdquo;&mdash;he
      faltered, his voice could barely support itself&mdash;&ldquo;but if it should
      ever appear that your confidence has been misplaced&mdash;if in the time
      to come I should seem to be unworthy of this honour, untrue to the oath I
      took to-day to do God's justice between man and man, a wrongdoer, not a
      righter of the wronged, a whited sepulchre where you looked for a tower of
      refuge&mdash;remember, I pray of you, my countrymen, remember, much as you
      may be suffering then, there will be one who will be suffering more&mdash;that
      one will be myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general impression that night was that the Deemster's speech had not
      been a proper one. Breaking up with some damp efforts at the earlier
      enthusiasm, the people complained that they were like men who had come for
      a jig and were sent home in a wet blanket. There should have been a joke
      or two, a hearty word of congratulation, a little natural glorification of
      Ramsey, and a quiet slap at Douglas and Peel and Castletown, a few
      fireworks, a rip-rap or two, and some general illumination. &ldquo;But sakes
      alive! the solemn the young Dempster was! And the melancholy! And the
      mystarious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chut!&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;There's such a dale of comic in you, boys. Wonder in
      the world to me you're not kidnapped for pantaloonses. Go home for all and
      wipe your eyes, and remember the words he's been spaking. I'm not going to
      forget them myself, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Handing over the big drum to little Jonaique, Pete turned to go into the
      house. Auntie Nan was in the hall, hopping like a canary about Philip, in
      a brown silk dress that rustled like withered ferns, hugging him, drawing
      him down to the level of her face, and kissing him on the forehead. The
      tears were raining over the autumn sunshine of her wrinkled cheeks, and
      her voice was cracking between a laugh and a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy! My dear boy! My boy's boy! My own boy's own boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip freed himself at length, and went upstairs without turning his
      head, and then Auntie Nan saw Pete standing in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you, Pete?&rdquo; she said with an effort. &ldquo;Won't you come in for a
      moment? No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A minute only, then&mdash;just to wish you joy, Miss Christian, ma'am,&rdquo;
       said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, too, Peter. Ah!&rdquo; she said, with a bird-like turn of the head,
      &ldquo;you must be a proud man to-night, Pete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proud isn't the word for it, ma'am&mdash;I'm clane beside myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He took a fancy to you when you were only a little barefooted boy, Pete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he did, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now that he's Deemster itself he owns you still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, lave him alone for that, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear what he said about you in his speech. It isn't everybody in
      his place would have done that before all, Pete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Deed no, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's true to his friends, whatever they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True as steel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maid was carrying the dishes into the dining-room, and Auntie Nan said
      in a strained way, &ldquo;You won't stay to dinner, Pete, will you? Perhaps you
      want to get home to the mistress. Well, home is best for all of us, isn't
      it? Martha, I'll tell the Deemster myself that dinner is on the table.
      Well, good-night, Peter. I'm always so glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was whisking about to go upstairs, but Pete had taken one step into
      the dining-room, and was gazing round with looks of awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord alive, Miss Christian, ma'am, what feelings now-barefooted boy, you
      say? You're right there, and cold and hungry too, sleeping in the
      gable-house with the cow, and not getting much but the milk I was staling
      from her, and a leathering at the ould man for that. Philip fetched me in
      here one evenin'&mdash;that was the start, ma'am. See that pepper-and-salt
      egg on the string there? It's a Tommy Noddy's. Philip got it nesting up
      Gob-ny-Garvain. Nearly cost him his life, though. You see, ma'am, Tommy
      Noddy has only one, and she fights like mad for it. We were up forty
      fathom and better, atop of a cave, and had two straight rocks below us in
      the sea, same as an elephant's hoofs, you know, walking out on the blue
      floor. And Phil was having his lil hand on the ledge where the egg was
      keeping, when swoop came the big white wings atop of his bare head. If I
      hadn't had a stick that day, ma'am, it would have been heaven help the
      pair of us. The next minute Tommy Noddy was going splash down the cliffs,
      all feathers and blood together, or Philip wouldn't have lived to be
      Dempster.... Aw, frightened you, have I, ma'am, for all it's so long ago?
      The heart's a quare thing, now, isn't it? Got no yesterday nor to-morrow
      neither. Well, good-night, ma'am.&rdquo; Pete was making for the door, when he
      looked down and said, &ldquo;What's this, at all? Down, Dempster, down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog had came trotting into the hall as Pete was going out. He was
      perking up his big ears and wagging his stump of a tail in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dog, ma'am? Yes, ma'am, and like its master in some ways. Not much of
      itself at all, but it has the blood in it, though, and maybe it'll come
      out better in the next generation. Looking for me, are you, Dempster?
      Let's be taking the road, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you're wanted at home, Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't trust. Good night, ma'am.&rdquo; Auntie Nan hopped upstairs in her
      rustling dress, relieved and glad in the sweet selfishness of her love to
      get rid of Pete and have Philip to herself.

      XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pete went off whistling in the darkness, with the dog driving ahead of
      him. &ldquo;I'm to blame, though,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Should have gone home directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The town was now quiet, the streets were deserted, and Pete began to run.
      &ldquo;She'd be alone, too. That must have been Nancy in the crowd yonder by
      Mistress Beatty's. 'Lowed her out to see the do, it's like. Ought to be
      back now, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Pete came near to Elm Cottage, the moon over the tree-tops lit up the
      panes of the upper windows as with a score of bright lamps. One step more,
      and the house was dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll be waiting for me. Listening, too, I'll go bail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was at the gate by this time, and the dog was panting at his feet with
      its nose close to the lattice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, dog, be quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he raised the latch without a sound, stepped in on tiptoe, and closed
      the gate as silently behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have a game with her; I'll take her by surprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes began to dance with mischief, like a child's, and he crept along
      the path with big cat strides, half doubled up, and holding his breath,
      lest he should laugh aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sweet creatures! A man shouldn't frighten them, though,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the porch he went down on all fours, and began mewing like
      a mournful tom-cat near to the bottom of the door. Then he listened with
      his ear to the jamb. He expected a faint cry of alarm, the raucous voice
      of Nancy Joe, and the clatter of feet towards the porch. There was not a
      sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's upstairs,&rdquo; he thought, and stepped back to look up at the front of
      the house. There was no light in the rooms above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what it is. Nancy is not home yet, and Kirry's fallen asleep at
      the rocking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stole up to the window and tried to look into the hall, but the blind
      was down, and he could not see much through the narrow openings at the
      sides of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's sleeping, that's it. The house was quiet and she dropped off,
      rocking the lil one, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He scraped a handful of the light gravel and flung a little of it at the
      window. &ldquo;That'll remind her of something,&rdquo; he thought, and he laughed
      under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he listened again with his ear at the sill. There was no noise
      within. He flung more gravel and waited, thinking he might catch her
      breathing, but he could hear nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then rising hurriedly and throwing off his playfulness, he strode to the
      door and tried to open it. The door was locked. He returned to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate!&rdquo; he called softly. &ldquo;Kate! Are you there? Do you hear me? It's Pete.
      Don't be frightened, Kate, bogh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no response. He could hear the beat of the sea on the shore. The
      dog had perched himself on one end of the window sill and was beginning to
      whine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this at all? She can't be out. Couldn't take the child anyway.
      Where's that Nancy? What right had the woman to lave her? She has fainted,
      being left alone; that's what's going doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to open the window, but the latch was shot. Then he tried the
      other windows, and the back door, and the window above the hall, which he
      reached from the roof of the porch; but they would not stir. When he
      returned to the hall window, the white blind was darker. The lamp inside
      the room was going out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moonlight was dripping down on him through the leaves of the trees. He
      found some matches beside his pipe in his side pocket, struck one, and
      looked at the sash, then took out his clasp knife to remove the pane under
      the latch. His hand trembled and shook and burst through the glass with a
      jerk. It cut his wrist, but he felt the wound no more than if it had been
      the glass instead of his arm that bled. He thrust his hand through, shot
      back the latch, then pushed up the sash, and clambered into the room past
      the blind. The cat, sitting on the ledge inside, rubbed against his hand
      and purred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kirry! Kate!&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lamp had given up its last gleam with the puff of wind from the
      window, and, save for the slumbering fire, all was dark within the house.
      He hardly dared to drop to his feet for fear of treading on something.
      When he was at last in the middle of the floor he stood with legs apart,
      struck another match, held the light above his head, and looked down and
      around, like a man in a cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing. The child, awakened by the draught of the night air,
      began to cry from the cradle. He took it up and hushed it with baby words
      of tenderness in a breaking voice. &ldquo;Hush, bogh, hush! Mammie will come to
      it, then. Mammie will come for all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lit a candle and crept through the house, carrying the light about with
      him. There was no sign anywhere until he came to the bedroom, when he saw
      that the hat and cloak of Kate's daily wear had gone. Then he knew that he
      was a broken-hearted man. With a cry of desolation he stopped in his
      search and came heavily downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been warding off the moment of despair, but he could do so no
      longer now. The empty house and the child, the child and the empty house;
      these allowed of only one interpretation. &ldquo;She's gone, bogh, she's left
      us; she wasn't willing to stay with us, God forgive her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sitting on a stool with the little one on his knees, he sobbed while the
      child cried&mdash;two children crying together. Suddenly he leapt up. &ldquo;I'm
      not for believing it,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;What woman alive could do the like of
      it? There isn't a mother breathing that hasn't more bowels. And she used
      to love the lil one, and me too&mdash;and does, and does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw how it was. She was ill, distraught, perhaps even&mdash;God help
      her I&mdash;perhaps even mad. Such things happened to women after
      childbirth&mdash;the doctor himself had said as much. In the toils of her
      bodily trouble, beset by mental terrors, she had fled away from her baby,
      her husband, and her home, pursued by God knows what phantoms of disease.
      But she would get better, she would come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, bogh, hush, then,&rdquo; he whimpered tenderly. &ldquo;Mammie will come home
      again. Still and for all she'll come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was the click of a key in the lock, and he crept back to the stool.
      Nancy came in, panting and perspiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear heart alive! what a race I've had to get home,&rdquo; she said, puffing
      the air of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was throwing off her bonnet and shawl, and talking before looking
      round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such pushing and scrooging, you never seen the like, Kirry. Aw, my best
      Sunday bonnet, only wore at me once, look at the crunched it is! But what
      d'ye think now? Poor Christian Killip's baby is dead for all. Died in the
      middle of the rejoicings. Aw, dear, yes, and the band going by playing
      'The Conquering Hero' the very minute. Poor thing! she was distracted, and
      no wonder. I ran round to put a sight on the poor soul, and&mdash;&mdash;why,
      what's going wrong with the lamp, at all? Is that yourself on the stool,
      Kirry? Pete, is it? Then where's the mistress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She plucked up the poker, and dug the fire into a blaze. &ldquo;What's doing on
      you, man? You've skinned your knuckles like potato peel. Man, man, what
      for are you crying, at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Pete said in a thick croak, &ldquo;Hould your bull of a tongue, Nancy, and
      take the child out of my arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took the baby from him, and he rose to his feet as feeble as an old
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord save us!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;The window broke, too. What's happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; growled Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what's coming of Kirry? I left her at home when I went out at
      seven.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm choking with thirst, woman. Can't you be giving a man a drink of
      something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found a dish of milk on the table, where the supper had been laid, and
      he gulped it down at a mouthful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's gone&mdash;that's what it is. I see it in your face.&rdquo; Then going to
      the foot of the stairs, she called, &ldquo;Kirry! Kate! Katherine Cregeen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; shouted Pete, and he drew her back from the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why aren't you spaking, then?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;If you're man enough to bear
      the truth, I'm woman enough to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Nancy,&rdquo; said Pete, with uplifted fist. &ldquo;I'm going out for
      an hour, and till I'm back, stay you here with the child, and say nothing
      to nobody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; cried Nancy. &ldquo;That's what she hurried me out for. Aw, dear!
      Aw, dear! What for did you lave her with that man this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear me, woman?&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;say nothing to nobody. My heart's
      lying heavy enough already. Open your lips, and you'll kill me straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he went out of the house, staggering, stumbling, bent almost double.
      His hat lay on the floor; he had gone bareheaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned towards Sulby. &ldquo;She's there,&rdquo; he thought &ldquo;Where else should she
      be? The poor, wandering lamb wants home.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The bar-room of &ldquo;The Manx Fairy&rdquo; was full of gossips 'that night, and the
      puffing of many pipes was suspended at a story that Mr. Jelly was telling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange enough, I'm thinking. 'Deed, but it's mortal strange. Talk about
      tale-books&mdash;there's nothing in the 'Pilgrim's Progress' itself to
      equal it. The son of one son coming home Dempster, with processions and
      bands of music, at the very minute the son of the other son is getting
      kicked out of the house same as a dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange uncommon,&rdquo; said John the Widow, and other voices echoed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonaique looked round the room, expecting some one to question him. As
      nobody did so, except with looks of inquiry, he said, &ldquo;My ould man heard
      it all. He's been tailor at the big house since the time of Iron Christian
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truth enough,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he was sewing a suit for the big man in the kitchen when the bad work
      was going doing upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You've robbed me!' says the Ballawhaine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear heart alive!&rdquo; cried Grannie. &ldquo;To his own son, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You've cheated me!' says he, 'you deceaved me, you've embezzled my money
      and broke my heart!' says he. 'I've spent a fortune on you, and what have
      you brought me back?' says he. 'This,' says he, 'and this&mdash;and this&mdash;barefaced
      forgeries, all of them!' says he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord help us!&rdquo; muttered Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'They're calling me a miser, aren't they?' says he. 'I grind my people to
      the dust, do I? What for, then? <i>Whom</i> for? I've been a good father
      to you, anyway, and a fool, too, if nobody knows it!' says he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody! Did he say nobody, Mr. Jelly?&rdquo; said Cæsar, screwing up his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'If you'd had <i>my</i> father to deal with,' says he, 'he'd have turned
      you out long ago for a liar and a thief.' 'My God, father,' says Ross,
      struck silly for the minute. 'A thief, d'ye hear me?' says the
      Ballawhaine; 'a thief that's taken every penny I have in the world, and
      left me a ruined man.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say that?&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did, though,&rdquo; said Jonaique. &ldquo;The ould man was listening from the
      kitchen-stairs, and young Ross snaked out of the house same as a cur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where's he gone to?&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone to the devil, I'm thinking,&rdquo; said Jonaique.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he'd be good enough for him with a broken back&mdash;pity the ould
      man didn't break it,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;But where is the wastrel now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone to England over with to-night's packet, they're saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Praise God, from whom all blessings flow,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      A grunt came out of the corner from behind a cloud of smoke. &ldquo;You've your
      own rasons for saying so, Cæsar,&rdquo; said the husky voice of Black Tom.
      &ldquo;People were talking and talking one while there that he'd be 'bezzling
      somebody's daughter, as well as the ould miser's money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer a fool according to his folly,&rdquo; muttered Cæsar; and then the door
      jerked open, and Pete came staggering into the room. Every pipe shank was
      lowered in an instant, and Grannie's needles ceased to click.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete was still bareheaded, his face was ghastly white, and his eyes
      wandered, but he tried to bear himself as if nothing had happened. Smiling
      horribly, and nodding all round, as a man does sometimes in battle the
      moment the bullet strikes him, he turned to Grannie and moved his lips a
      little as if he thought he was saying something, though he uttered no
      sound. After that he took out his pipe, and rammed it with his forefinger,
      then picked a spill from the table, and stooped to the fire for a light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody&mdash;belonging&mdash;me&mdash;here?&rdquo; he said, in a voice like a
      crow's, coughing as he spoke, the flame dancing over the pipe mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Pete, no,&rdquo; said Grannie. &ldquo;Who were you looking for, at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Nobody partic'lar. Aw, no,&rdquo; he said, and he puffed
      until his lips quacked, though the pipe gave out no smoke. &ldquo;Just come in
      to get fire to my pipe. Must be going now. So long, boys! S'long! Bye-bye,
      Grannie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one answered him. He nodded round the room again and smiled fearfully,
      crossed to the door with a jaunty roll, and thus launched out of the house
      with a pretence of unconcern, the dead pipe hanging upside down in his
      mouth, and his head aside, as if his hat had been tilted rakishly on his
      uncovered hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone the company looked into each other's faces in surprise
      and fear, as if a ghost in broad daylight had passed among them. Then
      Black Tom broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that was a d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Si&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Cæsar, but the protest foundered in his
      dry throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something going doing in Ramsey,&rdquo; Black Tom continued. &ldquo;I believe in my
      heart I'll follow him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be going along with you, Mr. Quilliam,&rdquo; said Jonaique.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said John the Clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said the others, and in half a minute the room was
      empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; whimpered Grannie, through the glass partition, &ldquo;hadn't you
      better saddle the mare and see if any thing's going wrong with Kirry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking the same myself, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, then, away with you. The Lord have mercy on all of us!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As soon as he was out of earshot Pete began to run. Within half an hour he
      was back at Elm Cottage. &ldquo;She'll be home by this time,&rdquo; he told himself,
      but he dared not learn the truth too suddenly. Creeping up to the hall
      window, he listened at the broken pane. The child was crying, and Nancy
      Joe was talking to herself, and sobbing as she bathed the little one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless its precious heart, it's as beautiful as the angels in heaven. I've
      bathed her mother on the same knee a hundred times. 'Deed have I, and a
      thousand times too. Mother, indeed! What sort of mothers are in now at
      all? She must have a heart-as hard as a stone to lave the like of it.
      Can't be a drop of nature in her.... Goodness, Nancy, what are saying for
      all? Kate is it? Your own little Kirry, and you blackening her! Aw, dear!&mdash;aw,
      dear! The bogh!&mdash;the bogh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete could not go in. He crept back to the cabin in the garden and leaned
      against it to draw his breath and think. Then he noticed that the dog was
      on the path with its long tongue hanging over its jaw. It stopped its
      panting to whine woefully, and then it turned towards the darker part of
      the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's telling me something,&rdquo; thought Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      A car rattled down the side road at that moment, and the light of its lamp
      shot through the bushes to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ould gate must be open,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked and saw that it was, and then a new light dawned on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's gone up to Philip's,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;She's gone by Claughbane to
      Ballure to find me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes afterwards he was knocking at Ballure House. His breath was
      coming in gusts, perspiration was standing in beads on his face, and his
      head was still bare, but he was carrying himself bravely as if nothing
      were amiss. His knock was answered by the maid, a tall girl of cheerful
      expression, in a black frock, a white apron, and a snow-white cap. Pete
      nodded and smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody been here for me? No?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, n&mdash;o, I think not,&rdquo; the girl answered, and as she looked at
      Pete her face straightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a rustling within as of autumn leaves, and then a twittering
      voice cried, &ldquo;Is it Capt'n Quilliam, Martha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some whispered conference took place at the dining-room door, and Auntie
      Nan came hopping through the hall. But Pete was already moving away in the
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I call the Deemster, Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, no, ma'am, no, not worth bothering him. Good everin', Miss Christian,
      ma'am, good everin' to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Auntie Nan and Martha were standing in the light at the open door when the
      iron gate of the garden swung to with a click, and Pete swung across the
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was making for the lane which goes down to the shore at the foot of
      Ballure Glen. &ldquo;No denying it,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;It must be true for all. The
      trouble in her head has driven her to it. Poor girl, poor darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had been fighting against an awful idea, and the quagmire of despair
      had risen to his throat at last. The moon was behind the cliffs, and he
      groped his way through the shadows at the foot of the rocks like one who
      looks for something which he dreads to find. He found nothing, and his
      catchy breathing lengthened to sighs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, not here, anyway!&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he walked down the shore towards the harbour. The tide was still
      high, the wash of the waves touched his feet; on the one hand the dark
      sea, unbroken by a light, on the other the dull town blinking out and
      dropping asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the end of the stone pier at the mouth of the harbour, and with
      his back to the seaward side of the lighthouse he stared down into the
      grey water that surged and moaned under the rounded wall. A black cloud
      like a skate was floating across the moon, and a startled gannet scuttled
      from under the pier steps into the moon's misty waterway. There was
      nothing else to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned back towards the town, following the line of the quay, and
      glancing down into the harbour when he came to the steps. Still he saw
      nothing of the thing he looked for. &ldquo;But it was high water then, and now
      it's the ebby tide,&rdquo; he told himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had met with nobody on the shore or on the pier, but as he passed the
      sheds in front of the berth for the steamers he was joined by the
      harbour-master, who was swinging home for the night, with his coat across
      his arm. Then he tried to ask the question that was slipping off his
      tongue, but dared not, and only stammered awkwardly&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any news to-night, Mr. Quay le?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it yourself, Capt'n? If you've none, I've none. It's independent young
      rovers like you for newses, not poor ould chaps tied to the harbour-post
      same as a ship's cable. I was hearing you, though. You'd a power of music
      in the everin' yonder. Fine doings up at Ballure, seemingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing fresh with yourself then, Daniel? No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except that I am middling sick of these late sailings, and the sooner
      they're building us a breakwater the better. If the young Deemster will
      get that for us, he'll do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were nearing a lamp at the corner of the marketplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's like you know the young Ballawhaine crossed with the boat to-night?
      Something wrong, with the ould man, they're telling me. But boy, veen,
      what's come of your hat at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My hat?&rdquo; said Pete, groping about his head. &ldquo;Oh, my hat? Blown off on the
      pier, of coorse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Deed, man! Not much wind either. You'll be for home and the young wife,
      eh, Capt'n?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must be,&rdquo; said Pete, with an empty laugh. And the harbour-master, who was
      a bachelor, laughed more heartily, and added&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You married men are like Adam, you've lost the rib of your liberty, but
      you've got a warm little woman to your side instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! ha! Goodnight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete's laugh echoed through the empty market-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The harbour-master had seen nothing. Pete drew a long breath, followed the
      line of the harbour as far as to the bridge at the end of it, and then
      turned back through the town. He had forgotten again that he was
      bareheaded, and he walked down Parliament Street with a tremendous step
      and the air of a man to whom nothing unusual had occurred. People were
      standing in groups at the corner of every side street, talking eagerly,
      with the low hissing sound that women make when they are discussing
      secrets. So absorbed were they that Pete passed some of them unobserved.
      He caught snatches of their conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rascal,&rdquo; said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clane ruined the ould man, anyway,&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ross Christian again,&rdquo; thought Pete. But a greater secret swamped
      everything. Still he heard the people as he passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sarve her right, though, whatever she gets&mdash;she knew what he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laving the child, too, the unfeeling creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the sharp voices of the women fell on the dull consciousness of Pete
      like forks of lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whisht, woman! the husband himself,&rdquo; said somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a noise of feet like the plash of retiring waves, and Pete
      noticed that one of the groups had broken into a half circle, facing him
      as he strode along the street. He nodded cheerfully over both sides, threw
      back his bare head, and plodded on. But his teeth were set hard, and his
      breathing was quick and audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see what they mane,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside his own house he found a crowd. A saddle-horse, with a cloud of
      steam rising from her, was standing with the reins over its head, linked
      to the gate-post. It was Cæsar's mare, Molly. Every eye was on the house,
      and no one saw Pete as he came up behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Black Tom's saying there's not a doubt of it,&rdquo; said a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone with the young Ballawhaine, eh?&rdquo; said a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shame on her, the hussy,&rdquo; said another woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete ploughed his way through with both arms, smiling and nodding
      furiously. &ldquo;If you, plaze, ma'am I If <i>you</i> plaze.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he pushed on he heard voices behind him. &ldquo;Poor man, he doesn't know
      yet.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I'm taking pity to look at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The house-door was open. On the threshold stood a young man with long hair
      and a long note-book. He was putting questions. &ldquo;Last seen at seven
      o'clock&mdash;left alone with child&mdash;husband out with procession&mdash;any
      other information?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy Joe, with the child on her lap, was answering querulously from the
      stool before the fire, and Cæsar, face down, was leaning on the
      mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete took in the situation at a glance. Then he laid his big hand on the
      young man's shoulder and swung him aside as if he had been turning a
      swivel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What going doing?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man faltered something. Sorry to intrude&mdash;Capt'n Quilliam's
      trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What trouble?&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Need I say&mdash;the lamented&mdash;I mean distressing&mdash;in fact, the
      mysterious disappearance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What disappearance?&rdquo; said Pete, with an air of amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be, sir, that you've not yet heard&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard what? Your tongue's like a turnip-watch in a fob pocket&mdash;out
      with it, man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wife, Captain&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? My wife disa&mdash;&mdash; What? So this is the jeel! My wife
      mysteriously disappear&mdash;&mdash; Oh, my gough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete burst into a peal of laughter. He shouted, roared, held his sides,
      doubled, rocked up and down, and at length flung himself into a chair,
      threw back his head, heaved out his legs, and shook till the house itself
      seemed to quake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's good! that's rich! that bates all!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child awoke on Nancy's knee and sent its thin pipe through Pete's
      terrific bass. Cæsar opened his mouth and gaped, and the young man, now
      white and afraid, scraped and backed himself to the door, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then perhaps it's not true, after all, Capt'n?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of coorse it's not true,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you know where she's gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I know where's she's gone. I sent her there myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did, though?&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, did I&mdash;to England by the night sailing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Deed, man!&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor ordered it. You heard him yourself, grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's true, too,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man closed his long note-book and backed into a throng of women
      who had come up to the porch. &ldquo;Of course, if you say so, Capt'n Quilliam&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do say so,&rdquo; shouted Pete; and the reporter disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voices of two women came from the gulf of white faces wherein the
      reporter had been swallowed up. &ldquo;I'm right glad it's lies they've been
      telling of her, Capt'n,&rdquo; said the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of coorse you are, Mistress Kinnish,&rdquo; shouted Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could never have believed the like of the same woman, and I always knew
      the child was brought up by hand,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coorse you couldn't, Mistress Kewley,&rdquo; Pete replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he swung up and kicked the door to in their faces. The strangers being
      shut out, Cæsar said cautiously&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mane that, Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Molly's smoking at the gate like a brewer's vat, father,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The half hasn't been told you, Peter. Listen to me. It's only proper you
      should hear it. When you were away at Kim-berley this Ross Christian was
      bothering the girl terrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll be getting cold so long out of the stable,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rebuked him myself, sir, and he smote me on the brow. Look! Here's the
      mark of his hand over my temple, and I'll be carrying it to my grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ross Christian! Ross Christian!&rdquo; muttered Pete impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Lord's restraining grace, sir, I refrained myself&mdash;but if Mr.
      Philip hadn't been there that night&mdash;I'm not hould-ing with violence,
      no, resist not evil&mdash;but Mr. Philip fought the loose liver with his
      fist for me; he chastised him, sir; he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;the man!&rdquo; cried Pete, leaping to his feet. &ldquo;What's
      he to me or my wife either?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar went home huffed, angry, and unsatisfied. And then, all being gone
      and the long strain over, Pete snatched the puling child out of Nancy's
      arms, and kissed it and wept over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give her to me, the bogh,&rdquo; he cried, hoarse as a raven, and then sat on
      the stool before the fire, and rocked the little one and himself together.
      &ldquo;If I hadn't something innocent to lay hould of I should be going mad,
      that I should. Oh, Katherine bogh! Katherine bogh! My little bogh! My I'll
      bogh millish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the deep hours of the night, after Nancy had grumbled and sobbed
      herself to sleep by the side of the child, Pete got up from the sofa in
      the parlour and stole out of the house again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may come up with the morning tide,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;If she does,
      what matter about a lie, God forgive me? God help me, what matter about
      anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If she did not, he would stick to his story, so that when she came back,
      wherever she had been, she would come home as an honest woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And <i>will be</i>, too,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Yes, will be, too, spite of all
      their dirty tongues&mdash;as sure as the Lord's in heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog trotted on in front of him as he turned up towards Ballure.

    <h2>
      XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Philip had not eaten much that night at dinner. He had pecked at the wing
      of a fowl, been restless, absent, preoccupied, and like a man struggling
      for composure. At intervals he had listened as for a step or a voice, then
      recovered himself and laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Auntie Nan had explained his uneasiness on grounds of natural excitement
      after the doings of the great day. She had loaded his plate with good
      things, and chirruped away under the light of the lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So sweet of you, Philip, not to forget Pete amid all your success. He's
      really such a good soul. It would break his heart if you neglected him.
      Simple as a child, certainly, and of course quite uneducated, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete is fit to be the friend of any one, Auntie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The friend, yes, but you'll allow not exactly the companion&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he is simple, it is the simplicity of a nature too large for little
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dear fellow! He's not a bit jealous of you, Philip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such feelings are far below him, Auntie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's your first cousin after all, Philip. There's no denying that. As he
      says, the blood of the Christians is in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation took a turn. Auntie Nan fell to talking of the other
      Peter, uncle Peter Christian of Ballawhaine. This was the day of the big
      man's humiliation. The son he had doted on was disgraced. She tried, but
      could not help it; she struggled, but could not resist the impulse&mdash;in
      her secret heart the tender little soul rejoiced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a pity,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;So touching when a father&mdash;no matter how
      selfish&mdash;is wrecked by love of a thankless son. I'm sorry, indeed I
      am. But I warned him six years ago. Didn't I, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was far away. He was seeing visions of Pete going home, the
      deserted house, the empty cradle, the desolate man alone and heart-broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rose from the table and went into the little parlour, Auntie Nan on
      Philip's arm, proud and happy. She fluttered down to the piano and sang,
      to cheer him up a little, an old song in a quavering old voice.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Of the wandering falcon
        The cuckoo complains,
    He has torn her warm nest,
        He has scattered her young.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Suddenly Philip got up stiffly, and said in a husky whisper, &ldquo;Isn't that
      his voice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, dearest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear nobody. Let me look. No, Pete's not here. But how pale you are,
      Philip. What's amiss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;I only thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take some wine, dear, or some brandy. You've overtired yourself to-day,
      and no wonder. You must have a long, long rest to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes I'll go to bed at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So soon! Well, perhaps it's best. You want sleep: your eyes show that.
      Martha! Is everything ready in the Deemster's room? All but the lamp? Take
      it up, Martha. Philip, you'll drink a little brandy and water first? I'll
      carry it to your room then; you might need it in the night. Go before me,
      dear. Yes, yes, you must. Do you think I want you to see how old I am when
      I'm going upstairs? Ah! I hadn't to climb by the banisters this way when I
      came first to Bal-lure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the landing, Philip was turning to his old room, the bedroom
      he had occupied from his boyhood up, the bedroom of his mother's father,
      old Capt'n Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that way to-night, Philip. This way&mdash;<i>there!</i> What do you
      say to <i>that?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pushed open the door of the room opposite, and the glow of the fire
      within rushed out on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father's room,&rdquo; said Philip, and he stepped back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I've aired it, and it's not a bit the worse for being so long shut
      up. See, it's like toast Oo&mdash;oo&mdash;oo! Not the least sign of my
      breath. Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Auntie, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you afraid of ghosts? There's only one ghost lives here, Philip, the
      memory of your dear father, and that will never harm you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this place is too sacred. No one has slept here since&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's why, dearest. But now you have justified your father's hopes, and
      it must be your room for the future. Ah! if he could only see you himself,
      how proud he would be! Poor father! Perhaps he does. Who knows&mdash;perhaps&mdash;kiss
      me, Philip. See what an old silly I am, after all. So happy that I have to
      cry. But mind now, you've got to sleep in this room every time you come to
      hold court in Ramsey. I refuse to share you with Elm Cottage any longer.
      Talk about jealousy! If Pete isn't jealous, I know somebody who is&mdash;or
      soon will be. But Philip&mdash;Philip Christian&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sweet old face grew solemn. &ldquo;The greatest man has his cares and doubts
      and divisions. That's only natural&mdash;out in the open field of life.
      But don't be ashamed to come here whenever you are in trouble. It's what
      home is for, Philip. Just a place of peace and shelter from the rough
      world, when it wounds and hurts you. A quiet spot, dear, with memories of
      father and mother and innocent childhood&mdash;and with an old goose of an
      auntie, maybe, who thinks of you all day and every day, and is so vain and
      foolish&mdash;and&mdash;and who loves you. Philip, better than anybody in
      the World.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip's arms were about the old soul, but he had not heard her. With a
      terrified glance towards the window, he was saying in a low quick voice,
      &ldquo;Isn't that a footstep on the gravel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N&mdash;o, no! You're nervous to-night, Philip. Lie and rest. When you're
      asleep, I'll creep back and look at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She left him, and he looked around. Not in all the world could Philip have
      found a spot so full of terrors. It was like a sepulchre of dead things&mdash;his
      dead father, his dead mother, his dead youth, his dead innocence, his
      slaughtered friendship, and his outraged conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the fireplace hung a portrait of his mother. It was the picture of a
      comely girl, young and soft, with full ripe lips and bright brown eyes.
      Philip shuddered as he looked at it. The portrait was like the ghost of
      himself looking through the veil of a woman's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Facing this, and hanging over the side of the bed, was a portrait of his
      father. The eyes were full of light, the lines of the cheek were round;
      the mouth seemed to quiver with a tender smile. But Philip could not see
      it as it was. He saw it with straggling hair, damp and long as reeds, the
      cheeks pallid and drawn, the eyes like lamps in a mist, the throat bare of
      the shirt, and the lips kept apart by laboured breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the window stood the cot where he had once slept with Pete, and
      leaped up in the morning and laughed. On every hand, wherever his eye
      could rest, there rose a phantom of his lost and buried life. And Auntie
      Nannie's love and pride had brought him to this chamber of torture!
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was calm enough outside; but it seemed to lie dead within that
      room, so quiet was it and so still. There was a clock, but it did not go;
      and there was a cage for a bird, but no bird pecked in it, Philip thought
      he heard a knocking at the door of the house. Nobody answered it, so he
      rang for the maid. She came upstairs with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you hear a knock at the front door, Martha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange! Very strange! I could have sworn it was the knock of Mr.
      Quilliam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it was, sir. Ill go and look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter. I've a singing in my ears to-night. It must be that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl left him. He threw off his boots and began to creep about the
      room as if he were doing something in which he feared detection. Every
      time his eyes fell on the portrait of his father he dropped his head and
      turned aside. Presently he heard voices in the room below. This time the
      sound in his ears was no dreaming. He opened the door noiselessly and
      listened. It was Pete. Martha was answering him. Auntie Nan was calling
      from the dining-room, and Pete was saying &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; in a light way and
      moving off. The gate of the garden clicked and the front door was closed
      quietly. Then Philip shut the door of his own room without a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later Auntie Nan re-opened it. She was carrying a lighted candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such an extraordinary thing, Philip. Martha says you thought you heard
      Peter knocking, and, do you know, he must have been coming up the hill at
      that very moment. He was so strange, too, and looked so wild. Asked if
      anybody had been here inquiring for him; as if anybody should. Wouldn't
      have me call to you, and went off laughing about nothing. Really, if I
      hadn't known him for a sober man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip felt sick-and chill, and-he began to shiver. An irresistible
      impulse took hold of him. It was like the half-smothered fear which makes
      guilty men go to sit at the inquests on their murdered victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something wrong,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where are my boots?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to Elm Cottage, Philip? Pity the coachman drove back to Douglas.
      Hadn't you better send Martha? Besides, it may be only my fancy. Why worry
      in any case? You're too tender-hearted&mdash;indeed you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip fled downstairs like one who flies from torture. While dragging on
      his coat in the hall, he began to foresee what was before him. He was to
      go to Pete, pretending to know nothing; he was to hear Pete's story, and
      show surprise; he was to comfort Pete&mdash;perhaps to help him in his
      search, for he dared not appear <i>not</i> to help&mdash;he was to walk by
      Pete's side, looking for what he knew they should not find. He saw himself
      crawling along the streets like a snake, and the part he had to play
      revolted him. He went upstairs again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On second thoughts, you must be right, auntie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If not, he'll come again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure he will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there's anything amiss with Pete, he'll come first to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be nothing amiss except what I say. Just a glass too much maybe
      and no great sin either, considering the day, and how proud he is, for
      your sake, Philip. I believe in my heart that young man couldn't be
      prouder and happier if he stood in your own shoes instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Auntie,&rdquo; said Philip, in a thick gurgle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, dear. I'm going to bed, and mind you go yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Being alone, Philip found himself leaning against the mantelpiece and
      looking across at his father's picture. He began to contrast his father
      with himself. He was a success, his father had been a failure. At
      seven-and-twenty he was Deemster at all events; at thirty his father had
      died a broken man. He had got what he had worked for; he had recovered the
      place of his people; and yet how mean a man he was compared to him who had
      done nothing and lost all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Failure was all that his father had had to reproach himself with; but he
      had to accuse himself of dishonour as well. His father's offence had been
      a fault; his own was a crime. If his father had been willing to betray
      love and friendship, he might have succeeded. Because he himself had been
      true to neither, he had not failed. The very excess of his father's
      virtues had kept him down. Every act of his own selfishness had pushed him
      up. His father had thought first of love and truth and an upright life,
      and last of money and rank and applause. The world had renounced his
      father because his father had first renounced the world. But it had opened
      its arms to him, and followed him with shouts and cheers, and loaded him
      with honours. And yet, miserable man, better be down in the ooze and slime
      of a broken life, better be dead and in the grave&mdash;for the dead in
      his grave must despise him.
    </p>
    <p>
      An awful picture rose before Philip. It was a picture of himself in the
      time to come. An old man&mdash;great, powerful, perhaps even beloved,
      maybe worshipped, but heart-dead, tottering on to the grave, and the
      mockery of a gorgeous funeral, with crowds and drums and solemn music.
      Then suddenly a great silence, as if the snow had begun to fall, and a
      great white light, and an awful voice crying, &ldquo;Who is this that comes with
      dust for a bleeding heart, and ashes for a living soul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip screamed aloud at the vision, as piece by piece he put it together.
      His cry died off with a tingle in the china ornaments of the mantelpiece,
      and he remembered where he was. Then two gentle taps came to the door of
      his room. He composed himself a little, snatched up a book, and cried
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Auntie Nan. She was in her night-dress and night-cap. A candle was
      in her hand, and the flame was shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever's to do, my child?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only reading aloud, Auntie. Did I awaken you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you screamed, Philip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Macbeth, Auntie. See, the banquet scene. He has become king, you know,
      but his conscience&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped. The little lady looked at him dubiously and made a pull at the
      string of her night-cap, causing it to fall aside and give a grotesque
      appearance to her troubled old face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a little brandy, dear. I left it here on the dressing-table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't trouble about me, Auntie. Good-night again. There! go back to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half coaxing, half forcing her, he drew her to the door, and she went out
      slowly, reluctantly, doubtfully, the wandering strings of her cap trailing
      on her shoulders, and her bare feet nipping up the bottom of the
      night-dress behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip looked at the book he had snatched up in his haste. What had put
      that book of all books into his hand? What had brought him to that room of
      all rooms? And on that night of all nights? What devil out of hell had
      tempted Auntie Nan to torture him? He would not stay; he would go back to
      his own bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out on the landing he heard a low voice. It came from Auntie Nan's room. A
      spear of candle-light shot from her door, which was ajar. He paused and
      looked in. The white night-dress was by the bedside, the night-cap was
      buried in the counterpane. A cat had established itself beside it, and was
      purring softly. Auntie Nan was on her knees. Philip heard his own name&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless my Philip in the great place to which he has been called this
      day. Give him wisdom and strength and peace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holy woman, with angels hovering over you, who dared to think of devils
      tempting your innocence and love?
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip went back to his father's room. He began to reconcile himself to
      his position. Though he had been extolling his father at his own expense,
      what had he done but realise his father's hopes. And, after all, he could
      not have acted differently. At no point could he have behaved otherwise
      than he had. What had he to accuse himself for? If there had been sin, he
      had been dragged into it by blind powers which he could not command. And
      what was true of himself was also true of Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! he could see her now. She was gone where he had sent her. There were
      tears in her beautiful eyes, but time would wipe them away. The duplicity
      of her old life was over; the corroding deceit, the daily torment, the
      hourly infidelity&mdash;all were left behind. If there was remorse, it was
      the fault of destiny; and if she was suffering the pangs of shame, she was
      a woman, and she would bear it cheerfully for the sake of the man she
      loved. She was going through everything for him. Heaven bless her! In
      spite of man and man's law, she was his love, his darling, his wife&mdash;yes,
      his wife&mdash;by right of nature and of God; and, come what would, he
      should cling to her to the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a thick voice cut through the still air of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Pete at last He was calling up at the window from the path below.
      Philip groaned and covered his face with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With rigid steps Philip walked to the window and threw up the sash. It was
      starlight, and the branches were bending in the night air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you, Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's me. I was seeing the lamp, so I knew you war'n in bed at all.
      Studdying a bit, it's like, eh? I thought I wouldn't waken the house, but
      just shout up and tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Pete?&rdquo; said Philip. His voice shivered like a sail at
      tacking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing much at all. Only the wife's gone to England over by the night's
      steamer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, time for it too, I'm thinking; the wake and narvous she's been
      lately. You remember what the doctor was saying yonder everin,' when we
      christened the child? 'Send her out of the island,' says he, 'and she'll
      be coming home another woman.' Wasn't for going, though. Crying and
      shouting she wouldn't be laving the lil one. So I had to put out a bit of
      authority. Of course, a husband's got the right to do that, Philip, eh?
      Well, I'll be taking the road again. Doing a fine night, isn't it? Make's
      a man unwilling to go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip trembled and felt sick. He tried to speak, but could utter nothing
      except an inarticulate noise. As Pete went off, an owl screeched in the
      glen. Philip drew down the sash, pulled the blind, tugged the curtains
      across, stumbled into the middle of the floor, and leaned against the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such is the beginning of the end,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duplicity, the deceit, the daily torment which Kate had left behind,
      were henceforward to be his own! At one flash, as of lightning, he saw the
      path before him. It was over cliffs and chasms and quagmires, where his
      foot might slip at any step.
    </p>
    <p>
      His head began to reel. He took the brandy bottle from the dressing-table,
      poured out half a tumbler, and drained it at one draught. As he did so,
      his eyes above the rim of the glass rested on the portrait of his mother
      over the fireplace. The face as he saw it then was no longer the face of
      the winsome bride. It was the living face as he remembered it&mdash;bleared,
      bloated, gross, and drunken. She smiled on him, she beckoned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the beginning of the end indeed. He was his mother's son as well as
      his father's. The father had ruled down to that day, but it was the turn
      of the mother now. He could not resist her. She was alive in his blood,
      and he was hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never before had he touched raw spirits, and the brandy mastered him
      instantly. Feeling dizzy, he made an effort to undress and get into bed.
      He dragged off his coat and his waistcoat, and threw his braces over his
      shoulders. Then he stumbled, and he had to lay hold of the bedpost. His
      hand grew chill and relaxed its hold. Stupor came over him. He slipped, he
      slid, he fell, and rolled with outstretched arms on to the floor. The fire
      went out and the lamp died down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the sun came up over the sea. It was a beautiful morning. The town
      awoke; people hailed each other cheerfully in the streets, and joy-bells
      rang from the big church tower for the first court-day of the new
      Deemster. But the Deemster himself still lay on the floor, with damp
      forehead and matted hair, behind the blind of the darkened room.

    <p>
      It was Saturday, and the market-place was covered with the carts and
      stalls of the country people. After some feint of eating breakfast, Pete
      lit his pipe, called for a basket, and announced his intention of doing
      the marketing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming for the mistress, are you, Capt'n?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a sort of a grass-widow, ma'am. What's your eggs to-day, Mistress
      Cowley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixteen this morning, sir, and right ones too. They were telling me
      you've been losing her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a shilling's worth, then. Any news over your side, Mag?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two&mdash;four&mdash;eight&mdash;sixteen&mdash;it's every appearance
      we'll be getting a early harvest, Capt'n.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it yourself, Liza? And how's your butter to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad to bate to-day, sir, and only thirteen pence ha'penny. Is the lil one
      longing for the mistress, Capt'n?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take a couple of pounds, then. What for longing at all when it's
      going bringing up by hand it is? Put it in a cabbage leaf, Liza.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus, with his basket on his arm and his pipe in his mouth, Pete passed
      from stall to stall, chatting, laughing, bargaining, buying, shouting his
      salutations over the general hum and hubbub, as he ploughed his way
      through the crowd, but listening intently watching eagerly, casting out
      grapples to catch the anchor he had lost, and feeling all the time that if
      any eye showed sign of knowledge, if any one began with &ldquo;Capt'n, I can
      tell you where she is,&rdquo; he must leap on the man like a tiger, and strangle
      the revelation in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, Sunday, his friends from Sulby came to quiz and to question. He
      was lounging in his shirt-sleeves on a deck-chair in his ship's cabin,
      smoking a long pipe, and pretending to be at ease and at peace with all
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine morning, Capt'n,&rdquo; said John the Clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> doing a fine morning, John,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine on the sea, too,&rdquo; said Jonaique.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful fine on the sea, Mr. Jelly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A nice fair wind, though, if anybody was going by the packet to
      Liverpool. Was it as good, think you, for the mistress on Friday night,
      Mr. Quilliam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll gallantee,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plucky, though&mdash;I wouldn't have thought it of the same woman&mdash;I
      wouldn't raelly,&rdquo; said Jonaique.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone, too, and landing on the other side so early in the morning,&rdquo; said
      John the Clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smart, uncommon! It isn't every woman would have done it,&rdquo; said Kelly the
      Postman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, we've mighty boys of women deese days&mdash;we have dough,&rdquo; snuffled
      the constable, and then they all laughed together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete watched their wheedling, fawning, and whisking of the tail, and then
      he said, &ldquo;Chut! What's there so wonderful about a woman going by herself
      to Liverpool when she's got somebody waiting at the stage to meet her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The laughing faces lengthened suddenly. &ldquo;And had she, then,&rdquo; said John the
      Clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete puffed furiously, rolled in his seat, laughed like a man with a mouth
      full of water, and said, &ldquo;Why, sartenly&mdash;my uncle, of coorse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jonaique wrinkled his forehead. &ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; he said, with a click in his
      throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my Uncle Joe,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonaique looked helplessly across at John the Clerk. John the Clerk
      puckered up his mouth as if about to whistle, and then said, in a
      faltering way, &ldquo;Well, I can't really say I've ever heard tell of your
      Uncle Joe before, Capt'n.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo; said Pete, with a look of astonishment. &ldquo;Not my Uncle Joseph? The
      one that left the island forty years ago and started in the coach and cab
      line? Well, that's curious. Where's he living? Bless me, where's this it
      is, now? Chut! it's clane forgot at me. But I saw him myself coming home
      from Kimberley, and since then he's been writing constant. 'Send her
      across,' says he; 'she'll be her own woman again like winking.' And you
      never heard tell of him? Not Uncle Joey with the bald head? Well, well! A
      smart ould man, though. Man alive, the lively he is, too, and the
      laughable, and the good company. To look at that man's face you'd say the
      sun was shining reg'lar. Aw, it's fine times she'll be having with Uncle
      Joe. No woman could be ill with yonder ould man about. He'd break your
      face with laughing if it was bursting itself with a squinsey. And you
      never heard tell of my Uncle Joe, of Scotland Road, down Clarence Dock
      way? To think of that now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went off with looks of perplexity, and Pete turned into the house.
      &ldquo;They're trying to catch me; they're wanting to shame my poor lil Kirry. I
      must keep her name sweet,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church bells had begun to ring, and he was telling himself that, heavy
      though his heart might be, he must behave as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll be going walking to church herself this morning, Nancy,&rdquo; he said,
      putting on his coat, &ldquo;so I'll just slip across to chapel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was swinging up the path on his return home to dinner, when he heard
      voices inside the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's shocking to see the man bittending this and bittending that.&rdquo; It was
      Nancy; she was laying the table; there was a rattle of knives and forks.
      &ldquo;Bittending to ate, but only pecking like a robin; bittending to sleep,
      but never a wink on the night; bittending to laugh and to joke and wink,
      and a face at him like a ghose's, and his hair all through-others. Walking
      about from river to quay, and going on with all that rubbish&mdash;it's
      shocking, ma'am, it's shocking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush-a-bye, hush-a-bye!&rdquo; It was the voice of Grannie, low and quavery;
      she was rocking the cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't spake to him neither but he's scolding you scandalous. 'I'm not
      used of being cursed at,' I'm saying, 'and is it myself that has to be
      tould to respect my own Kitty?' But cry shame on her I must when I look at
      the lil bogh there, and it so helpless and so beautiful. 'Stericks, you
      say? Yes, indeed, ma'am, and if I stay here much longer, it's losing
      myself I will be, too, with his bittending and bittending.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lave him to it, Nancy. His poor head's that moidered and mixed it's like
      a black pudding&mdash;there's no saying what's inside of it. But he's
      good, though; aw, right good he is for all, and the world's cold and
      cruel. Lave him alone, woman; lave him alone, poor boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child awoke and cried, and, under cover of this commotion and the
      crowing and cooing of the two women, Pete stepped back to the gate,
      clashed it hard, swung noisily up the gravel, and rolled into the house
      with a shout and a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! Grannie, my gough! Who'd have thought of seeing Grannie, now?
      And how's the ould angel to-day? So you've got the lil one there? Aw, you
      rogue, you. You're on Grannie's lap, are you? How's Cæsar? And how's Mrs.
      Gorry doing? Look at that now&mdash;did you ever? Opening one eye first to
      make sure if the world's all right. The child's wise. Coo&mdash;oo&mdash;oo!
      Smart with the dinner, Nancy&mdash;wonderful hungry the chapel's making a
      man. Coo&mdash;oo! What's she like, now, Grannie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I set her to my knee like this I can see my own lil Kirry again,''
      said Grannie, looking down ruefully, rocking the child with one knee and
      doubling over it to kiss it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she's like the mammy, is she?&rdquo; said Pete, blowing at the baby and
      tickling its chin with his broad forefinger. &ldquo;Mammy's gone to the ould
      uncle's&mdash;hasn't she, my lammie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that Grannie fell to rocking herself as well as the child, and to
      singing a hymn in a quavery voice. Then with a rattle and a rush, throwing
      off his coat and tramping the floor in his shirt-sleeves, while Nancy
      dished up the dinner, Pete began to enlarge on Kate's happiness in the
      place where she had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tremenjous grand the ould man's house is&mdash;you wouldn't believe. A
      reg'lar Dempster's palace. The grandeur on it is a show and a pattern.
      Plenty to ate, plenty to drink, and a boy at the door with white buttons
      dotting on his brown coat, bless you like&mdash;like a turnip-field in
      winter. Then the man himself; goodness me, the happy that man is&mdash;Happy
      Joe they're calling him. Wouldn't trust but he'll be taking Kate to a
      theaytre. Well, and why not, if a person's down a bit? A merry touch and
      go&mdash;where's the harm at all? Fact is, Grannie, that's why we couldn't
      tell you Kate was going. Cæsar would have been objecting. He's fit enough
      for it&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grannie looked up at Pete as he laughed, and the broad rose withered on
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm! h'm!&rdquo; he said, clearing his throat; &ldquo;I'm bad dreadful wanting a
      smook.&rdquo; And past the dinner-table, now smoking and ready, he slithered out
      of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar was Pete's next visitor. He said nothing of Kate, and neither did
      Pete mention Uncle Joe. The interview was a brief and grim one. It was a
      lie that Ross Christian had been sent by his father to ask for a loan, but
      it was true that Peter Christian was in urgent need of money. He wanted
      six thousand pounds as mortgage on Ballawhaine. Had Pete got so much to
      lend? No need for personal intercourse; Cæsar would act as intermediary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete took only a moment for consideration. Yes, he had got the money, and
      he would lend it. Cæsar looked at Pete; Pete looked at Cæsar. &ldquo;He's
      talking all this rubbish,&rdquo; thought Cæsar, &ldquo;but he knows where the girl has
      gone to. He knows who's taken her; he manes to kick the rascal out of his
      own house neck and crop; and right enough, too, and the Lord's own
      vengeance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Pete's thoughts were another matter. &ldquo;The ould man won't live to
      redeem it, and the young one will never try&mdash;it'll do for Philip some
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>

    </div>
    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For three days Pete bore himself according to his wont, thinking to
      silence the evil tongues of the little world about him, and keep sweet and
      alive the dear name which they were waiting to befoul and destroy. By
      Tuesday morning the strain had become unbearable. On pretences of
      business, of pleasure, of God knows what folly and nonsense, he began to
      scour the island. He visited every parish on the north, passed through
      every village, climbed every glen, found his way into every out-of-the-way
      hut, and scraped acquaintance with every old woman living alone. Sometimes
      he was up in the vague fore-dawn, creeping through the quiet streets like
      a thief, going silently, stealthily, warily, until he came to the roads,
      or the fields, or the open Curragh, and could give swing to his step, and
      breath to his lungs, and voice to the cries that hurst from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two long weeks he spent in this wild quest, and meanwhile he was as happy
      as a boy to all outward seeming&mdash;whistling, laughing, chaffing,
      bawling, talking nonsense, any nonsense, and kicking up his heels like a
      kid. But wheresoever he went, and howsoever early he started on his
      errands, he never failed to be back at home at seven o'clock in the
      evening&mdash;washed, combed, in his slippers and shirt-sleeves, smoking a
      long clay over the garden gate as the postman went by with the letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll write,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;When she's mending a bit she'll aise our
      mind and write. 'Dear ould Pete, excuse me for not writing afore'&mdash;that'll
      he the way of it. Aw, trust her, trust her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But day followed day, and no letter came from Kate. Ten evenings running
      he smoked over the gate, leisurely, largely, almost languidly, hut always
      watching for the peak of the postman's cap as it turned the corner by the
      Court-house, and following the toes of his foot as they stepped off the
      curb, to see if they pointed in his direction&mdash;and then turning aside
      with a deep breath and a smothered moan that ended in a rattle of the
      throat and a pretence at spitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postman saw him as he went by, and his little eyes twinkled
      treacherously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing for you yet, Capt'n,&rdquo; he said at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chut!&rdquo; said Pete, with a mighty puff of smoke; &ldquo;my business isn't done by
      correspondence, Mr. Kelly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, no; but when a man's wife's away&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the postman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; said Pete, with a look of intelligence, and then, with a
      lofty wave of the hand, &ldquo;She's like her husband, Mr. Kelly&mdash;not
      bothering much with letters at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be longing for a line, though, Capt'n&mdash;that's only natural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No news is good news&mdash;I can lave it with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of coorse, that's truth enough, yes! But still and for all, a taste of a
      letter&mdash;it's doing no harm, Capt'n&mdash;aisy writ, too, and sweet to
      get sometimes, you know&mdash;shows a woman isn't forgetting a man when
      she's away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Kelly! Mr. Kelly!&rdquo; said Pete, with his hand before his face, palm
      outwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not necessary? Well, I lave it with you. Good-night, Capt'n.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night to you, sir,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had laughed and tut-tutted, and lifted his eyebrows and his hands in
      mock protest and a pretence of indifference, but the postman's talk had
      cut him to the quick. &ldquo;People are suspecting,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;They're saying
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This made him swear, but a thought came behind that made him sweat
      instead. &ldquo;Philip will be hearing them. They'll be telling him she doesn't
      write to me; that I don't know where she is; that she has left me, and
      that she's a bad woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To make Kate stand well with Philip was an aim that had no rival but one
      in Pete's reckoning&mdash;to make Philip stand well with Kate. Out of the
      shadow-land of his memory of the awful night of his bereavement, a
      recollection, which had been lying dead until then, came back now in its
      grave-clothes to torture him. It was what Cæsar had said of Philip's fight
      with Ross Christian. Philip himself had never mentioned it&mdash;that was
      like him. But when evil tongues told of Ross and hinted at mischief,
      Philip would know something already; he would be prepared, perhaps he
      would listen and believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days longer Pete sat in the agony of this new terror and the dogged
      impatience of his old hope. &ldquo;She'll write. She'll not lave me much
      longer.&rdquo; But she did not write, and on the second night, before returning
      to the house from the gate, he had made his plan. He must silence scandal
      at all hazards. However his own heart might bleed with doubts and fears
      and misgivings, Philip must never cease to think that Kate was good and
      sweet and true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off to bed, Nancy,&rdquo; he cried, heaving into the hall like a man in drink.
      &ldquo;I've work to do to-night, and want the house to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness me, is it yourself that's talking of bed, then?&rdquo; said Nancy.
      &ldquo;Seven in the everin', too, and the child not an hour out of my hands? And
      dear knows what work it is if you can't be doing it with good people about
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, get off, woman; you're looking tired mortal. The lil one's ragging
      you ter'ble. But what's it saying, Nancy&mdash;bed is half bread. Truth
      enough, too, and the other half is beauty. Get off, now. You're spoiling
      your complexion dreadful&mdash;I'll never be getting that husband for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus coaxing her, cajoling her, watching her, dodging her, nagging her,
      driving her, he got her off to bed at last. Being alone, he looked around,
      listened, shut the doors of the parlour and the kitchen, put the bolt on
      the door of the stairs, the chain on the door of the porch, took off his
      boots, and went about on tiptoe. Then he blew out the lamp, filled and
      trimmed and relit it, going down on the hearthrug to catch the light of
      the fire. After that he settled the table, drew up the armchair, took from
      a corner cupboard pens and ink, a blotting pad, a packet of notepaper and
      envelopes, a stick of sealing wax, a box of matches, a postage stamp, the
      dictionary, and the exercise-book in which Kate had taught him to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the clock was striking nine, Pete was squaring himself at the table,
      pen in hand, and his tongue in his left cheek. Half an hour later he was
      startled, by an interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo; he shouted in a ferocious voice, leaping up with a look of
      terror, like a man caught in a crime. It was only Nancy, who had come
      creeping down the stairs under pretence of having forgotten the baby's
      bottle. He made a sort of apologetic growl, handed the flat bottle through
      an opening like a crack, and ordered her back to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness sakes!&rdquo; said Nancy, going upstairs. &ldquo;Is it coining money the man
      is? Or is it whisky itself that's doing on him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two hours afterwards Pete fancied he saw a face at the window, and he
      caught up a stick, unchained the door, and rushed into the garden. It was
      no one; the town lay asleep; the night was all but airless; only the
      faintest breeze moved the leaves of the trees; there was no noise
      anywhere, except the measured beat of the sea in its everlasting coming
      and going on the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stepping back into the house, where the fire chirped and the kettle sang
      and all else was quiet, he resumed his task, and somewhere in the dark
      hours before the dawn he finished it. The fingers of his right hand were
      then inky up to the first joint, his collar was open, his neck was bare,
      his eyes were ablaze, the cords on his face were big and blue, great beads
      of cold sweat were standing on his forehead, and the carpet around his
      chair was littered as white as if a snowstorm had fallen on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went down on his knees and gathered up these remnants and burnt them,
      with the air of a man destroying the evidences of his guilt. Then he put
      back the ink and the dictionary, the blotting pad and sealing wax, and
      replaced them with a loaf of bread, a table knife, a bottle of brandy, and
      a drinking glass. After that he made up the fire with a shovel of slack,
      that it might burn until morning; removed the lamp from the table to the
      window recess that it might cast its light into the darkness outside; and
      unchained the outer door that a wanderer of the night, if any such there
      were, might enter without knocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did all this in the absent manner of a man who did it nightly. Then
      unbolting the staircase door, and listening a moment for the breathing of
      the sleepers overhead, he crept into the dark parlour overlooking the
      road, and lay down on the sofa to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was done! Pete's great scheme was afoot! The mighty secret which he had
      enshrouded with such awful mystery lay in an envelope in the inside
      breast-pocket of his monkey-jacket, signed, sealed, stamped, and
      addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pete had written a letter to himself</i>.

    <h2>
      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next day the crier was crying: &ldquo;Great meeting&mdash;Manx fishermen&mdash;on
      Zigzag at Peel when boats come in to-morrow morning&mdash;protest agen
      harbour taxes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing itself,&rdquo; thought Pete, with his hand pressed hard on the
      outside of his breast-pocket. At five o'clock in the afternoon he went
      down to the harbour, where his Nickey lay by the quay, shouted to the
      master, &ldquo;Take an odd man tonight, Mr. Kemish?&rdquo; then dropped to the deck
      and helped to fetch the boat into the bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had to haul her out by poles alone the quay wall, for the tide was
      low, and there was no breakwater. It was still early in the herring
      season, but the fishing was in full swing. Five hundred boats from all
      parts were making for the fishing round. It lay off the south-west tail of
      the island. Before Pete's boat reached it the fleet were sitting together,
      like a flight of sea-fowl, and the sun was almost gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun went down that night over the hills of Mourne very angry and red
      in its setting; the sky to the north-west was dark and sullen; the round
      line of the sea was bleared and broken, but there was little wind, and the
      water was quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring to and shoot,&rdquo; cried Pete, and they dropped sail to the landward of
      the fleet, off the shoulder of the Calf Island, with its two lights making
      one. The boat was brought head to the wind, with the flowing tide veering
      against her; the nets were shot over the starboard quarter, and they
      dropped astern; the bow was swung round to the line of the floating
      mollags, and boat and nets began to drift together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper was served, the pump was worked, the lights were run up, the small
      boat was sent round with a flare to fright away the evil spirits, and then
      the night came down&mdash;a dark night, without moon or stars, shutting
      out the island, though it stood so near, and even the rocks of the Hen and
      Chicken. The first man for the look-out took up his one hour's watch at
      the helm, and the rest went below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete's bunk was under the binnacle, and the light of its lamp fell on a
      stamped envelope which he took out of his breast-pocket from time to time
      that he might read the inscription. It ran&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Capn Peatr Quilliam,

     Lm Cottig Ramsey I O Man.
</pre>
    <p>
      He looked at it lovingly, fondly, yearningly, yet with a certain awe, too,
      as if it were the casket of some hidden treasure, and he hardly knew what
      it contained. The dim-lit cabin was quiet, the net boiler sparched drops
      of hot water at intervals, the fire of the cooking stove slid and fell,
      the men breathed heavily from unseen beds, and the sea washed as the boat
      rolled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's she saying, I wonder! I wonder! God bless her!&rdquo; he mumbled, and
      then he, too, fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours before hauling, they proved the fishing by taking in a &ldquo;pair&rdquo; of
      the net, found good herring, and blew the horn as signal that they were
      doing well. Then out of the black depths around, wherein no boat could be
      seen, the lights of other boats came floating silently astern, until the
      company about them in the darkness was like a little city of the sea and
      the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first peep of morning over the round shoulder of the Calf, the
      little city awoke. There were the clicks of the capstan, and the shouts of
      the men as the nets came back to the boats, heavy and white with fish. All
      being aboard, the men went down on the deck, according to their wont,
      every man on his knee with his face in his cap, and then leapt up with a
      shout (perhaps an oath), swung to the wind, hoisted the square sails, and
      made for home. The dark northwest was lowering by this time, and the sea
      was beginning to jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Breakfast, boys,&rdquo; sang out Pete, with his head above the companion, and
      all but the helmsman went below. There was a pot full of the drop-fish,
      and every man ate his warp of herring. It had been a great night's
      fishing. Some of the boats were full to the mouth, and all had plenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll do middling if we get a market,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've got to get home first,&rdquo; said the master, and at the same moment a
      sea struck the windward quarter with the force of a sledge-hammer, and the
      block at the masthead began to sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll run for Peel this morning, boys,&rdquo; said Pete, smothering his voice
      in a mouthful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peel?&rdquo; said the master, shooting out his lip. &ldquo;They've got no harbour
      there at all with a cat's paw of a breeze, let alone a northwester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm for going up to the meeting,&rdquo; said Pete in an incoherent way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they tacked before the rising gale, and went off with the fleet as it
      swirled like a flight of gulls abreast of the wind. The sea came tumbling
      down like a shoal of seahogs, and washed the faces of the men as they sat
      in oilskins on the hatch-head, shaking the herring out of the nets into
      the hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      But their work only began when they came into Peel. The tide was down;
      there was no breakwater; the neck of the harbour was narrow, and four
      hundred boats were coming to take shelter and to land their cargoes. It
      was a scene of tumult and confusion&mdash;shouting, swearing, and fighting
      among the men, and crushing and cranching among the boats as they nosed
      their way to the harbour mouth, threw ropes on to the quay, where fifty
      ropes were round one post already, or cast anchors up the bank of the
      castle rock, which was steep and dangerous to lie on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete got landed somehow, but his Nickey with half the fleet turned tail
      and went round the island. As he leapt ashore, the helpless
      harbour-master, who had been bellowing over the babel through a cracked
      trumpet, turned to him and said, &ldquo;For the Lord's sake, Capt'n Quilliam, if
      you've got a friend that can lend us a hand, go off to the meeting at
      seven o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mane to,&rdquo; said Pete, but he had something else to do first. It was the
      task that had brought him to Peel, and no eye must see him do it. Slowly
      and slyly, like one who does a doubtful thing and pretends to be doing
      nothing, he went stealing through the town&mdash;behind the old
      Court-house and up Castle Street, into the market-place, and across it to
      the line of shops which make the principal thoroughfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one of these shops, a little single-roomed place, with its small
      shutter still up, but the door half open and a noise of stamping going on
      inside, he stopped in a lounging way, half twisting on his heel as if idly
      looking back. It was the Post-Office.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a stealthy look around, he put a trembling hand into his
      breast-pocket, drew out the letter, screened it by the flat of his big
      palm, and posted it. Then he turned hurriedly away, and was gone in a
      moment, like a man who feared pursuit, down a steep and tortuous alley
      that led to the shore. The morning was early; the shops were not yet open;
      only the homes of the fishermen were putting out curling wreaths of smoke;
      the silent streets echoed to his lightest footstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the shore road was busy enough. Fishermen in sea-boots and
      sou'westers, with oilskin over one arm and a string of herring in the
      other hand, were trooping from the harbour up to the Zigzag by the rock
      called the Creg Malin. It was at the end of the bay, where cliff and beach
      and sea together form a bag like the cod-end of the trawl net.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not the fishermen at all&mdash;it's the farmers they're thinking
      of,&rdquo; said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right,&rdquo; said Pete, &ldquo;and it's some of ourselves that's to blame for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's that?&rdquo; said somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aisy enough,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;When I came home from Kimberly I met an ould
      fisherman&mdash;<i>you</i> know the man, Billy&mdash;well, <i>you</i> do,
      Dan&mdash;Phil Nelly, of Ramsey. 'How's the fishing, Phil?' says I. He
      gave me a Hm! and a heise of his neck, and 'I'm not fishing no more,' says
      he. 'The wife's keeping a private hotel,' says he. 'And what are you doing
      yourself,' says I. 'I'm walking about,' says he, and, gough bless me, if
      the man wasn't wearing a collar and carrying a stick, and prating about
      advertising the island, if you plaze.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of Pete's voice a group of the men gathered about him.
      &ldquo;That's not the worst neither,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The other day I tumbled over Tom
      Hommy&mdash;<i>you</i> know Tom Hommy, yes, you do, the lil deaf man up
      Ballure. He was lying in the hedge by the public-house, three sheets in
      the wind. 'Why aren't you out with the boats, Tom?' says I. 'Wash for
      should I go owsh wish the boash, when the childer can earn more on the
      roads?' says the drunken wastrel. 'And is yonder your boys and girls
      tossing summersaults at the tail of the trippers' car?' says I. 'Yesh,'
      says he; 'and they'll earn more in a day at their caperings than their
      father in a week at the herrings.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it enough,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;The man's about right,&rdquo; said another;
      and a querulous voice behind said, &ldquo;Wonderful the prosperity of the island
      since the visitors came to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out with you, there, for a disgrace to the name of Manxman,&rdquo; sang out
      Pete over the heads of those that stood between. &ldquo;With the farming going
      to the dogs and the fishing going to the divil, d'ye know what the ould
      island's coming to? It's coming to an island of lodging-house keepers and
      hackney-car drivers. Not the Isle of Man at all, but the Isle of
      Manchester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a tremendous shout at this last word. In another minute Pete was
      lifted shoulder high over the crowd on to the highest turn of the zigzag
      path, and bidden to go on. There were five hundred faces below him,
      putting out hot breath in the cool morning air. The sun was shooting over
      the cliffs a canopy as of smoke above their heads. On the top of the crag
      the sea-fowl were jabbering, and the white sea itself was climbing on the
      beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men,&rdquo; said Pete, &ldquo;there's not much to say. This morning's work said
      everything. We'd a right fishing last night, hadn't we? Four hundred boats
      came up to Peel, and we hadn't less than ten maise apiece. That's&mdash;you
      that's smart at your figguring and ciphering, spake out now&mdash;that's
      four thousand maise isn't it?&rdquo; (Shouts of &ldquo;Right.&rdquo;) &ldquo;Aw, you're quick
      wonderful. No houlding you at all when it's money that's in. Four thousand
      maise ready and waiting for the steamers to England&mdash;but did we land
      it? No, nor half of it neither. The other half's gone round to other
      ports, too late for the day's sailing, and half of that half will be going
      rotten and getting chucked back into the sea. That's what the Manx
      fishermen have lost this morning because they haven't harbours to shelter
      them, and yet they're talking of levying harbour dues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man veen, he's a boy!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He's all that&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Go it, Capt'n. What
      are we to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do?&rdquo; cried Pete. &ldquo;I'll tell you what you're to do. This is Friday. Next
      Thursday is old Midsummer Day. That's Tynwald Coort day. Come to St.
      John's on Thursday&mdash;every man of you come&mdash;come in your
      sea-boots and your jerseys&mdash;let the Governor see you mane it. 'Give
      us raisonable hope of harbour improvement and we'll pay,' says you. 'If
      you don't, we won't; and if you try to make us, we're two thousand strong,
      and we'll rise like one man.'Don't be freckened; you've a right to be
      bould in a good cause. I'll get somebody to spake for you. You know the
      man I mane. He's stood the fisherman's friend before to-day, and he isn't
      going taking off his cap to the best man that's setting foot on Tynwald
      Hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was agreed. Between that day and Tynwald day Pete was to enlist the
      sympathy of Philip, and to go to Port St. Mary to get the co-operation of
      the south-side fishermen. The town was astir by this time, the sun was on
      the beach, and the fishermen trooped off to bed.

    <h2>
      IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pete was back in his ship's cabin in the garden the same evening with a
      heart the heavier because for one short hour it had forgotten its trouble.
      The flowers were opening, the roses were creeping over the porch, the
      blackbird was singing at the top of the tree; but his own flower of
      flowers, his rose of roses, his bird of birds&mdash;where was she? Summer
      was coming, coming, coming&mdash;coming with its light, coming with its
      music, coming with its sweetness&mdash;but she came not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock struck seven inside the house, and Pete, pipe in hand, swung
      over to the gate. No need to-night to watch for the postman's peak, no
      need to trace his toes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter for you, Mr. Quilliam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing these words, Pete, his eyes half shut as if dosing in the sunset,
      wakened himself with a look of astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? For me, is it? A letter, you say? Aw, I see,&rdquo; taking it and turning
      it in his hand, &ldquo;just'a line from the mistress, it's like. Well, well! A
      letter for me, if you plaze,&rdquo; and he laughed like a man much tickled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in no hurry. He rammed his dead pipe with his finger, lit it again,
      sucked it, made it quack, drew a long breath, and then said quietly,
      &ldquo;Let's see what's her news at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the letter leisurely, and read bits of it aloud, as if reading
      to himself, but holding the postman while he did so in idle talk on the
      other side of the gate. &ldquo;And how are you living to-day, Mr. Kelly? Aw, h'm&mdash;<i>getting
      that much better</i> it's extraordinary&mdash;Yes, a nice everin', very,
      Mr. Kelly, nice, nice&mdash;<i>that happy and comfortable and Uncle Joe is
      that good</i>&mdash;heavy bag at you to-night, you say? Aw, heavy, yes,
      heavy&mdash;<i>love to Grannie and all inquiring friends</i>&mdash;nothing,
      Mr. Kelly, nothing&mdash;just a scribe of a line, thinking a man might be
      getting unaisy. She needn't, though&mdash;she needn't. But chut! It's
      nothing. Writing a letter is nothing to her at all. Why, she'd be knocking
      that off, bless you,&rdquo; holding out a half sheet of paper, &ldquo;in less than an
      hour and a half. Truth enough, sir.&rdquo; Then, looking at the letter again,
      &ldquo;What's this, though? PN. They're always putting a P.N. at the bottom of a
      letter, Mr. Kelly. P.N.&mdash;<i>I was expecting to be home before, but I
      wouldn't get away for Uncle Joe taking me to the theaytres</i>. Ha, ha,
      ha! A mighty boy is Uncle Joe. But, Mr. Kelly, Mr. Kelly,&rdquo; with a solemn
      look, &ldquo;not a word of this to Cæsar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The postman had been watching Pete out of the corners of his ferret eyes.
      &ldquo;Do you know, Capt'n, what Black Tom is saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; said Pete, with a sudden change of tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's saying there <i>is</i> no Uncle Joe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No Uncle Joe?&rdquo; cried Pete, lifting voice and eyebrows together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postman signified assent with a nod of his peak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's rich,&rdquo; said Pete, in a low breath, raising his face as if to
      invoke the astonishment of the sky itself. &ldquo;No Uncle Joe?&rdquo; he repeated, in
      a tone of blank incredulity. &ldquo;Ask the man if it's in bed he is. Why,&rdquo; and
      Pete's eyes opened and closed like a doll's, &ldquo;he'll be saying there's no
      Auntie Joney next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The postman looked up inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard of Auntie Joney&mdash;Uncle Joe's wife? No? Well, really,
      really&mdash;is it sleeping I am? Not Auntie Joney, the Primitive? Aw, a
      good ould woman as ever lived. A saint, if ever the like was in, and died
      a triumphant death, too. No theaytres for her, though. She won't bemane
      herself. No, but she's going to chapel reg'lar, and getting up in the
      middle of every night of life to say her prayers. 'Deed she is. So Black
      Tom says there is no Uncle Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete gave a long whistle, then stopped it sudden with his mouth agape, and
      said from his throat, &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his mouth close to the postman's ear and whispered, &ldquo;Ever hear
      Black Tom talk of the fortune he's expecting through the Coort of
      Chancery?&rdquo; The postman's peak bobbed downwards. &ldquo;You have? Tom's thinking
      to grab it all for himself. Ha, ha! That's it! Ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The postman went off blinking and giggling, and Pete reeled up the path,
      biting his lip, and muttering, &ldquo;Keep it up, Pete, keep it up&mdash;it's
      ploughing a hard furrow, though.&rdquo; Then aloud, &ldquo;A letter from the mistress,
      Nancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy met him in the porch, clearing her fingers, thick with dough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; said Pete, flapping the letter on one hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good sakes alive!&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;Did it come by the post, though, Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at the stamp, woman, and see for yourself,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My goodness me! From Kirry, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me in, then, and I'll be reading you bits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy went back to her kneading with looks of bewilderment, and Pete
      followed her, opening the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's well enough, Nancy&mdash;no need to read that part at all. But
      see,&rdquo; running his forefinger along the writing &ldquo;'<i>Kisses for the baby,
      and love to Nancy, and tell Grannie not to be fretting?</i> et setterer,
      et setterer. See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy looked up at her thumping and thunging, and said, &ldquo;Did Mr. Kelly
      give it you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did that,&rdquo; said Pete, &ldquo;this minute at the gate. It's his time, isn't
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy glanced at the clock. &ldquo;I suppose it must be right,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it in your hand, woman,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy cleaned her hands and took the letter, turned it over and felt it in
      her fingers as if it had been linen. &ldquo;And this is from Kirry, is it? It's
      nice, too. I haven't much schooling, Pete, but I'm asking no better than a
      letter myself. It's like a peppermint in your frock on Sunday&mdash;if
      you're low you're always knowing it's there, anyway.&rdquo; She looked at it
      again, and then she said, like one who says a strange thing, &ldquo;I once had a
      letter myself&mdash;'deed I had, Pete. It was from father. He went down in
      the <i>Black Sloop</i>, trading oranges with the blacks in their own
      island somewhere. They put into the port of London one day when they were
      having a funeral there. What's this one they were calling after the big
      boots&mdash;Wellingtons, that's the man. They were writing home all about
      it&mdash;the people, and the chariots, and the fighting horses, and the
      music in the streets and the Cateedrals&mdash;and we were never hearing
      another word from them again&mdash;never. 'To Miss Annie Cain&mdash;your
      affecshunet father, Joe Cain.' I knew it all off&mdash;every word&mdash;and
      I kept it ten years in my box under the lavender.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip came later. He was looking haggard and tired; his face was pallid
      and drawn; his eyes were red, quick, and wandering; his hair was neglected
      and ragged; his step was wavering and uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gough alive, man,&rdquo; cried Pete, &ldquo;didn't you take oath to do justice
      between man and man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip looked up with alarm. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried Pete, with a frown and a clenched fist, &ldquo;there's one man
      you're not doing justice to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's that?&rdquo; said Philip with eyes down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yourself,&rdquo; said Pete, and Philip drew a long breath. Pete laughed,
      protested that Philip must not work so hard, and then plunged into an
      account of the morning's meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tremenjous! Talk of enthusiasm! Man veen, man veen! Didn't I say we'd
      rise as one man? We will, too. We're going up to Tynwald Coort on Tynwald
      day, two thousand strong. Tynwald Coort? Yes, and why not? Drum and fife
      bands, bless you&mdash;two of them. Not much music, maybe, but there'll be
      noise enough. It's all settled. Southside fishermen are coming up Foxal
      way; north-side men going down by Peel. Meeting under Harry Delany's tree,
      and going up to the hill on mass (en masse). No bawling, though&mdash;no
      singing out&mdash;no disturbing the Coort at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! What then?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we're wanting you to spake for us, Dempster. Aw, nothing much&mdash;nothing
      to rag you at all. Just tell them flat we won't&mdash;that'll do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a serious matter, Pete. I must think it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, think and think enough, Dempster&mdash;but mind you do it, though.
      The boys are counting on you. 'He's our anchor and he'll hould,' they're
      saying; But, bother the harbours, anyway,&rdquo; reaching his hand for something
      on the mantelpiece. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Philip, with a long breath of weariness and relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess, then,&rdquo; said Pete, putting his hand behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip shook his head and smiled feebly. Then, with the expression of a
      boy on his birthday, Pete leaned over Philip, and said in a half-whisper
      across the top of his head, &ldquo;I've heard from Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip turned ghastly, his lip trembled, and he stammered, &ldquo;You've&mdash;you've&mdash;heard
      from Kate, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; cried Pete, and round came the letter with a triumphant
      sweep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip's respiration grew difficult and noisy. Slowly, very slowly, he
      reached out his hand, took the letter, and looked at its superscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it&mdash;read it,&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;no secrets at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With head down and eyebrows hiding his eyes, with trembling hands that
      tore the envelope, Philip took out the letter and read it in passages&mdash;broken,
      blurred, smudged, as by the smoke of a fo'c'stle lamp.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Deerest peat i am gettin that much better... i am that
     happy and comforbel... sometimes i am longing for a sight of
     the lil ones swate face... no more at present... ure own
     trew wife.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to the P. N. yet, Philip?&rdquo; said Pete. He was on his knees before the
      fire, lighting his pipe with a red coal.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;axpectin to be home sune but... give my luv and bess
     respects to the Dempster when you see him he was so good to me
     when &ldquo;were forren the half was never towl you&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's not laving a man unaisy, you see,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip could not speak. His throat was choking; his tongue filled his
      mouth; his eyes were swimming in tears that scorched them. Nancy, who had
      been up to Sulby with news of the letter, came in at the moment, and
      Philip raised his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told my aunt not to expect me to-night, Nancy. Is my room upstairs
      ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, yes, always ready, your honour,&rdquo; said Nancy, with a curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up, with head aside, took a candle from Nancy's hand, excused
      himself to Pete&mdash;he was tired, sleepy, had a heavy day to-morrow&mdash;said
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; and went upstairs&mdash;stumbling and floundering&mdash;tore
      open his bedroom door, and clashed it back like a man flying from an
      enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete thought he had succeeded to admiration, but he looked after Philip,
      and was not at ease. He had no misgivings. Writing was writing to him, and
      it was nothing more. But in the deep midnight, Philip, who had not slept,
      heard a thick voice that was like a sob coming from somewhere downstairs.
      He opened his door, crept out on to the stairhead, and listened. The house
      was dark. In some unseen place the voice was saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, forgive me for deceaving Philip. I couldn't help it, though; Thou
      knows, Thyself, I couldn't. A lie's a dirty thing, Lord. It's like chewing
      dough&mdash;it sticks in your throat and chokes you. But I had to do it to
      save my poor lost lamb, and if I didn't I should go mad myself&mdash;Thou
      knows I should. So forgive me, Lord, for Kirry's sake. Amen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thick voice stopped, the house lay still, then the child awoke in a
      room beyond, and its thin cry came through the darkness. Philip crept back
      in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what <i>she</i> had to go through! O God! My God!&rdquo;
     </p>

      V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cæsar called next day and took Pete to the office of the High Bailiff,
      where the business of the mortgage was completed. The deeds of Ballawhaine
      were then committed to Cæsar's care for custody and safe keeping, and he
      carried them off to his safe at the mill with a long stride and a face of
      fierce triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ould Ballawhaine is dying,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;and if we kick out the young
      one some day, it'll only be the Lord's hand on a rascal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On drawing his big cheque, Pete had realised that, with reckless spending,
      and more reckless giving, he had less than a hundred pounds to his credit.
      &ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;Philip will pay me back when he comes in to his
      own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grannie was with Nancy at Elm Cottage when Pete returned home. The child
      was having its morning bath, and the two women were on their knees at
      either side of the tub, cackling and crowing like two old hens over one
      egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, did you <i>ever</i>, now, Nancy? 'Deed, no; you never <i>did</i> see
      such a lil angel. Up-a-daisy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cry I must, Grannie, when I see it looking so beautiful. Warm towels, you
      say? I'm a girl of this sort&mdash;when I get my heart down, I can never
      get it up again. Fuller's earth, is it? Here, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boo&mdash;loo&mdash;loo! the bog millish! Nancy, we must be shortening
      her soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that they fell to an earnest council on frocks and petticoats,
      and other mysteries unread by man. Pete sat and watched and listened.
      &ldquo;People will be crying shame on her if they see the Grannie doing
      everything,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night he lounged through the town and examined the shop windows out
      of the corner of his eye. He was trying to bear himself like a workman
      enjoying his Saturday night's ramble in clean clothes, but the streets
      were thronged, and he found himself observed. &ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; he told himself.
      &ldquo;I can buy nothing here. Doesn't do to be asleep at all, and a man isn't
      always in bed when he's sleeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some hours later, Nancy and the child being upstairs, Pete bethought
      himself of something that was kept at the bottom of a drawer. Going to the
      drawer to open it, he found it stiff to his tugging, and it came back with
      a jerk, which showed it had not lately been disturbed. Pete found what he
      looked for, and came upon something beside. It was a cardboard box, tied
      about with a string, which was knotted in a peculiar way. &ldquo;Kate's knot,&rdquo;
       thought Pete with a sigh. He slipped it, and opened the lid and took out a
      baby's hood of scarlet plush. &ldquo;The very thing,&rdquo; he thought. He held it,
      mouth open, over his big brown hand, and laughed with delight. &ldquo;She's been
      buying it for the child and never using it.&rdquo; His eyes glistened. &ldquo;The <i>very</i>
      thing,&rdquo; he thought, and then he took down pen and paper to write something
      to go with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is what he wrote&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;For lil Katerin from her Luvin mother&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then he held it at arm's length and looked at it. The subscription crossed
      the whole face of a half-sheet of paper. But the triumphant success of his
      former effort had made him bold. He could not resist the temptation to
      write more. So he turned the paper over and wrote on the back&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;tell pa pa not to wurry about me i aspect to be home sune
     but dont no ezactly&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      His eyes were swimming by the time he got that down, but they brightened
      again as he remembered something.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Weve had grate times ear uncle Jo&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must go on milking that ould cow,&rdquo; he thought
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;tuk me to sea the prins of Wales yesterda&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He could not help it&mdash;he began to take a wild joy in his own
      inventions.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;flags and banns of musick all day and luminerashuns all
     night it was grand we were top of an umnibuss goin down lord
     strete and saw him as plane as plane&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me,&rdquo; said Pete, dropping his pen, and rubbing his hands in
      ravishing contemplation of his own fiction; &ldquo;the next thing we hear she'll
      be riding in her carriage and' pair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was sobbing a little, for all that, in a low, smothered way, but he
      could not deny himself one word more&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;luv to all enquirin frens and bess respecs to the Dempster
     if im not forgot at him.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This second forgery of love being finished, he went about the house on
      tiptoe, found brown paper and twine, put the hood back into the box with
      his half-sheet peeping from between the frills where the little face would
      go, and made it up, with his undeft fingers, into an ungainly parcel,
      which he addressed to himself as before. After that he did his accustomed
      duty with the lamp and the door, and lay down in the parlour to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Monday, at dinner, he broke out peevishly with &ldquo;Ter'ble botheration,
      Nancy&mdash;I must be going to Port St. Mary about that thundering
      demonstration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then from underneath the sofa in the parlour he rooted up a brown paper
      parcel, stuffed it under his coat, buttoned it up, and so smuggled it out
      of the house.

    <h2>
      VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      They set sail early in the afternoon, and ran down the coast under a fair
      breeze that made the canvas play until the sea hissed. The day was wet and
      cheerless; a thick mist enshrouded the land, and going by Laxey they could
      just descry the top arc of the great wheel like a dun-coloured ghost of a
      rainbow in a grey sky. As they came to Douglas the mist was lifting, but
      the rain was coming down in a soaking drizzle. A band was playing dance
      tunes on the iron pier, which shot like a serpent's tongue out of the
      mouth of the bay. The steamer from England was coming round the head, and
      her sea-sick passengers were dense as a crowd on her forward deck, the men
      with print handkerchiefs tied over their caps, the women with their skirts
      over their drooping feathers. A harp and a violin were scraping lively
      airs amidships. The town was like a cock with his tail down crowing
      furiously in the wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they came to Port St. Mary the mist had risen and the rain was gone,
      but the fishing-town looked black and sullen under a lowering cloud. The
      tide was down, and many boats lay on the beach and in the shallow water
      within the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete was put ashore; his Nickey went round the Calf to the herring ground
      beyond the shoulder; a number of fishermen were waiting for him on the
      quay, with heavy looks and hands deep in their trousers-pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need for much praiching at all,&rdquo; said Pete, pointing to the boats
      lying aground. &ldquo;There you are, boys, fifty of you at the least, with no
      room to warp for the rocks. Yet they're for taxing you for dues for a
      harbour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead, Capt'n,&rdquo; said one of the fishermen; &ldquo;there's five hundred men
      here to back you up through thick and thin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete posted his brown paper parcel as stealthily as he had posted his
      letter, and left Port St. Mary the same night for Douglas. The roads were
      thick with coaches, choked full with pleasure-seekers from Port Erin.
      These cheerful souls were still wearing the clothes which had been
      drenched through in the morning; their boots were damp and cold; they were
      chill with the night-air, but they did not repine. They sang and laughed
      and ate oranges, drew up frequently at wayside houses, and handed round
      bottles of beer with the corks drawn. In their own way they were bright
      and cheerful company. Sometimes &ldquo;Hold the Fort,&rdquo; sung in a brake going
      ahead, mingled with &ldquo;Molly and I and the Baby,&rdquo; from lusty throats coming
      behind. Battling through Castletown, they shouted wild chaff at the
      redcoats lounging by the Castle, and when the darkness fell they dropped
      asleep&mdash;the men usually on the women's shoulders; and then the
      horses' hoofs were heard splashing along the muddy road, and every rider
      cracked his whip over a chorus of stertorous snores.
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas was ablaze with light as they dipped down to it from the dark
      country. Long sinuous tails of light where the busy streets were, running
      in and out, this way and that, and belching into the wide squares and
      market-places like the race of a Curragh fire. The sleepers awoke and
      shook themselves. &ldquo;Going to the Castle to-night?&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;What do you
      think?&rdquo; said another, and they all laughed at the foolish question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll sleep here,&rdquo; thought Pete. &ldquo;I've not searched Douglas yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The driver found him a bed at his mother's house. It was a lodging-house
      in Church Street, overlooking the churchyard. Finding himself so near to
      Athol Street, Pete thought he would look at the outside of Philip's
      chambers. He lit on the house easily, though the street was dark. It was
      one of a line of houses having brass plates, each with its name, and
      always the word <i>Advocate</i>. Philip's house bore one plate only, a
      small one, with the name hardly legible in the uneertain light. It ran&mdash;<i>The
      Deemster Christian</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having spelt out this inscription, Pete crept away. That was the last
      house in the island at which he wished to call. He was almost afraid of
      being seen in the same town. Philip might think he was in Douglas to look
      for Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete rambled through the narrow thoroughfares of Post-Office Place,
      Heywood Lane, and Fancy Street, until he came to the sea front. It was now
      full tide of busy night, and the holiday town seemed to be given over to
      enjoyment. The steps of the terraces were thronged; itinerant
      photographers pitched their cameras on the curb-stones; every open window
      had its dark heads with the light behind; pianos were clashing in the
      houses, harps were twanging in the street, tinkling tram-cars, like
      toast-racks, were sweeping the curve of the bay; there was a steady flow
      of people on the pavement, and from water's edge to cliff top, three parts
      round like a horse's shoe, the town flashed and fizzed and sparkled and
      blazed under its thousand lights with the splendour of a forest fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete called to mind the blinking and groping of the dear old half-lit town
      to the north; he remembered the dark village at the foot of the lonely
      hills, with its trout-stream burrowing under the low bridge, and he
      thought, &ldquo;She may have tired of it all, poor thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at every woman's face as she went by him, hungering for one
      glimpse of a face he feared to see. He did not see it, and he wandered
      like a lost soul through the little gay town until he drifted with the
      wave that flowed around the bay into the place that was known as the
      Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a dancing palace in a garden, built in the manner of a
      conservatory, with the ground level for those who came to dance, and the
      galleries for such as came to see. Seated by the front rail of the
      gallery, Pete peered down into the faces below. Three thousand young men
      and young women were dancing, the men in flannels and coloured scarves,
      the women in light muslins and straw hats. Sometimes the white lights in
      the glass roof were coloured with red and blue and yellow. The low buzz of
      the dancers' feet, the clang and clash of the brass instruments, the boom
      of the big drum, the quake of the glass house itself, and the low rumble
      of the hollow floor beneath&mdash;it was like a battle-field set to music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may have tired, poor thing; God knows she may,&rdquo; thought Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were growing hazy and his head dizzy, when he became conscious of
      a waft of perfume behind him, and a soft voice saying at his ear, &ldquo;Were
      you looking for anybody, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned with a start, and looked at the speaker. It was a young girl
      with a pretty face, thick with powder. He could not be angry with the
      little thing; she was so young, and she was smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I <i>was</i> looking for somebody;&rdquo; and then he tried to
      shake her off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it Maudie, you mane, dear? Are you the young man from Dublin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lave me, my girl; lave me,&rdquo; said Pete, patting her hand, and twisting
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked at him with a sort of pity, and then close at his neck she
      said, &ldquo;A fine boy like you shouldn't be going fretting his heart about the
      best girl that's in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the pretty face again, and the little knowing airs began to
      break down. &ldquo;You're a Manx girl, aren't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile vanished like a flash. &ldquo;How do you know that? My tongue doesn't
      tell you, does it?&rdquo; And the little thing was ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete took the tight-gloved fingers in his big palm. &ldquo;So you're my lil
      countrywoman, then?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painted lips began to tremble. &ldquo;Sixteen for harvest,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; exclaimed Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      The darkened eyelids blinked; she was beginning to cry. &ldquo;It wasn't my
      fault. He was a visitor with my mother at Ballaugh, and he left me to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete took a sovereign out of his pocket, and shut it in the girl's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go home to-night, my dear,&rdquo; he whispered, and then he clambered out of
      the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not there!&rdquo; cried Pete in his heart; &ldquo;not there&mdash;I swear to God she
      is not there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That ended his search. He resolved to go home the same night, and he went
      back to his lodgings to pay his bill. Turning out of Athol Street, Pete
      was almost overrun by a splendid equipage, with two men in buff on the
      box-seat, and one man behind. &ldquo;The Governor's carriage,&rdquo; said somebody. At
      the next moment it drew up at Philip's door, its occupant alighted, and
      then it swung about and moved away. &ldquo;It was the young Deemster,&rdquo; said a
      girl to her companion, as she went skipping past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete had seen the tall, dark figure, bent and feeble, as it walked heavily
      up the steps. &ldquo;Truth enough,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;there's nothing got in this
      world without paying the price of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was three in the morning when Pete reached Ramsey, Elm Cottage was dark
      and silent. He had to knock again and again before awakening Nancy. &ldquo;Now,
      if this had been Kate!&rdquo; he thought, and a new fear took hold of him. His
      poor darling, his wandering lamb, could she have knocked twice? Where was
      she to-night? He had been picturing her in happiness and plenty&mdash;was
      she in poverty and distress? All the world was sleeping&mdash;was she
      asleep? His hope was slipping away; his great faith was breaking down.
      &ldquo;Lord, do not forsake me! Master, strengthen me! My poor lost love, where
      is she? What is she? Shall I see her face again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something cold touched his hand. It was the dog. Without a bark he had put
      his nose into Pete's palm. &ldquo;What, Dempster, man, Dempster!&rdquo; The bat's ears
      were cocked&mdash;Pete felt them&mdash;the scut of a tail was wagged, and
      Pete got comfort from the battered old friend that had tramped the world
      at his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy unchained the door, opened it an inch, held a candle over her head,
      and peered out. &ldquo;My goodness, is it the man himself? However did you come
      home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By John the Flayer's pony,&rdquo; said Pete; and he laughed and made light of
      his night-long walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      But next morning, when Nancy came downstairs with the child, Pete was busy
      with a screwdriver taking the chain off the door. &ldquo;Ter'ble ould-fashioned,
      these chains&mdash;must be moving with the times, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what are you putting in its place?&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll see, you'll see,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven that night Pete was smoking over the gate when Kelly the Thief
      came up with a brown paper parcel. &ldquo;Parcel for you, Mr. Quilliam,&rdquo; said
      the postman, with the air of a man who knew something he should not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete blinked and looked bewildered. &ldquo;You don't say!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if that's your name,&rdquo; began the postman, holding the address for
      Pete to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete gave it a searching look. &ldquo;Cap'n Peatr Quilliam, that's it sartenly,
      <i>Lm Cottig</i>&mdash;yes, it must be right,&rdquo; he said, taking the parcel
      gingerly. Then with a prolonged &ldquo;O&mdash;&mdash;o!&rdquo; shutting his eyes and
      nodding his head, &ldquo;I know&mdash;a bit of a present from the mother to the
      lil one. Wonderful thoughtful a woman is about a baby when she's a mother,
      Mr. Kelly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The postman giggled, threw his finger seaward over one shoulder, and said,
      &ldquo;Why aren't you writing back to her, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; said Pete sharply, making the parcel creak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why aren't you writing to tell her how the lil one is, I'm saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete looked at the postman as if the idea had dropped from heaven. &ldquo;I must
      have a head as thick as a mooring-post, Mr. Kelly. Do you know, I never
      once thought of it. I'm like Goliath when he got little David's stone at
      his forehead&mdash;such a thing never entered my head before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it for all, Mr. Quilliam,&rdquo; said the postman, moving off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, I will,&rdquo; said Pete; and then he turned into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scissors, Nancy,&rdquo; he shouted, throwing the parcel on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sakes, a parcel!&rdquo; cried Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aisy to tell where it comes from, too. See that knot, woman?&rdquo; said Pete,
      with a knowing wink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the world is it, Pete?&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder!&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Papers enough round it, anyway. A letter? We'll
      look at that after,&rdquo; he said loftily, and then out came the scarlet hood.
      &ldquo;Gough bless mee what's this thing at all?&rdquo; and he held it up by the
      crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy made a cry of alarm, took the hood out of his hand, and scolded him
      roundly. &ldquo;These men, they're fit to spoil an angel's wings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she whipped up the baby out of the cradle, tried the hood on the
      little round head, and shouted with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I was thinking of that, d'ye know?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was, yes, I was;
      believe me or not, I was. 'Kirry will be sending something for the lil one
      the next time she writes,' I was thinking, and behould ye&mdash;here it
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something spakes to us, Nancy,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;'Deed it does, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child gurgled and purred, and for all her fine headgear she was
      absorbed in her bare toes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there's yourself, Pete&mdash;going to Peel and to Douglas, and I
      don't know where&mdash;and you've never once thought of the lil one&mdash;and
      knowing we were for shortening her, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete cast down his head and looked ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no&mdash;of coorse&mdash;I never have&mdash;that's truth enough,&rdquo;
       he faltered.

    <h2>
      VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pete went out to buy a sheet of notepaper and an envelope, a pen, and a
      postage stamp. He had abundance of all theso at home, but that did not
      serve his turn. Going to as many shops as might be, he dropped hints
      everywhere of the purpose to which his purchases were to be put. Finally,
      he went to the barber's in the market-place and said, &ldquo;Will you write an
      address for me, Jonaique?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coorse I will,&rdquo; said the barber, sweeping a hand of velvet over one cheek
      of the postman, who was in the chair, leaving the other cheek in lather
      while he took up the pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistress Peter Quilliam, care of Master Joseph Quilliam, Esquire,
      Scotland Road, Liverpool&rdquo; dictated Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What number, Capt'n?&rdquo; said Jonaique.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Number?&rdquo; said Pete, perplexed. &ldquo;Bless me, what's this the number is now?
      Oh,&rdquo; by a sudden inspiration, &ldquo;five hundred and fifteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five hundred&mdash;d'ye say <i>five</i>&rdquo; said the postman from the half
      of his mouth that was clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five,&rdquo; said Pete emphatically. &ldquo;Aw, they're well up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If <i>you</i> say so, Capt'n,&rdquo; said the barber, and down went &ldquo;515.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete returned home with the stamped and addressed envelope open in his
      hands, &ldquo;Clane the table quick,&rdquo; he shouted; &ldquo;I must be writing to Kirry.
      Will I give her your love, Nancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With much hem-ing and ha-ing and clearing of his throat, Pete was settling
      himself before a sheet of note-paper, when the door opened, and Philip
      stepped into the house. His face was haggard and emaciated; his eyes
      burned as with a fire that came up from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've come to warn you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you are in great danger. You must stop
      that demonstration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, sir, sit down,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip did not seem to hear. He walked to and fro with short, nervous,
      noiseless steps. &ldquo;The Governor sent for me last night, and I found him in
      a frenzy. 'Deemster,' he said, 'they tell me there's to be a disturbance
      at Tynwald&mdash;have you heard of anything?' I said, 'Yes, I had heard of
      a meeting of fishermen at Peel.' 'They talk of their rights,' said he;
      'I'll teach them something of one right they seem to forget&mdash;the
      right of the Governor to shoot down the disturbers of Tynwald, without
      judge or jury.' 'That's a very old prerogative, your Excellency,' I said;
      'it comes down from more lawless days than ours. You will never use it.'
      'Will I not?' said he. 'Listen, I'll tell you what I've done already. I've
      ordered the regiment at Castletown to be on Tynwald Hill on Tynwald day.
      Every man of these&mdash;there are three hundred&mdash;shall have twenty
      rounds of ball-cartridge. Then, if the vagabonds try to interrupt the
      Court, I've only to lift my hand&mdash;so&mdash;and they'll be mown down
      like grass.' 'You can't mean it,' I said, and I tried to take his big talk
      lightly. 'Judge for yourself&mdash;see,' and he showed me a paper. It was
      an order for the ambulance waggons to be stationed on the ground, and a
      request to the doctors of Douglas to be present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we've made the ould boy see that we mane it,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'If you know any one of the ringleaders, Deemster,' he said, with a look
      into my face&mdash;somebody had been with him&mdash;there are tell-tales
      everywhere&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the way of the world still,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tell him,' said he, 'that I don't want to take the life of any man&mdash;I
      don't want to send any one to penal servitude.'&rdquo; It was useless to
      protest. The man was mad, but he was in earnest. His plan was folly&mdash;frantic
      folly&mdash;but it was based on a sort of legal right. &ldquo;So, for the Lord's
      sake, Pete, stop this thing. Stop it at once, and finally. It's life or
      death. If ever you thought my word worth anything, you'll do as I bid you,
      now. God knows where I should be myself if the Governor were to do what he
      threatens. Stop it, stop it; I haven't slept for thinking of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete had been sitting at the table, chewing the tip of the pen, and now he
      lifted to the paleness and wildness of Philip's face a cool, bold smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's good of you, Phil.... We've a right to be there, though, haven't
      we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've a right, certainly, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, by gough, we'll go,&rdquo; said Pete, dropping the pen, and bringing his
      fist down on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The penalty will be yours, Pete&mdash;yours. You are the man who will
      suffer&mdash;you first&mdash;you alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete smiled again. &ldquo;No use&mdash;I'm incorr'iblê. I'm like Dan-ny-Clae,
      the sheep-stealer, when he came to die. 'I'm going to eternal judgment&mdash;what'll
      I do?' says Dan. 'Give back all you've stolen,' says the parzon. 'I'll
      chance it first,' says the ould rascal. It's the other fellow that's for
      stealing this time; but I'll chance it, Philip. Death it may be, and
      judgment too, but I'll chance it, boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip's eyes wandered over the floor. &ldquo;Then you'll not change your plan
      for anything I've told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, though,&rdquo; said Pete, &ldquo;for one thing, anyway. <i>You</i> shan't be
      getting into trouble&mdash;I'll be spokesman for the fishermen myself. Oh,
      I'll spake enough if they get my dander up. I'll just square my arms
      acrost my chest and I'll say, 'Your Excellency,' I'll say, 'you can't do
      it, and you shan't do it&mdash;<i>because it isn't</i> right.' But chut!
      botheration to all such bobbery! Look here&mdash;man alive, look here!
      She's not forgetting the lil one, you see,&rdquo; and, making a proud sweep of
      the hand, Pete pointed to the scarlet hood. It had been put to sit across
      the back of a china dog on the mantelpiece, with Pete's half sheet of
      paper pinned to the strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip recognised it. The hood was the present he had made as godfather.
      His eyes blinked, his mouth twitched, the cords of his forehead moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she&mdash;she sent that,&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen here,&rdquo; said Pete, and he unpinned the paper and read the message
      aloud, with flourishes of voice and gesture&mdash;&ldquo;For lil Katherine from
      her loving mother... papa not to worry... love to all inquiring friends...
      best respects to the Dempster if Im not forgot at him.&rdquo; Then in an
      off-hand way he tossed the paper into the fire. &ldquo;Aw, what's a bit of a
      letter,&rdquo; he said largely, as it took flame and burned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip's bloodshot eyes seemed to be starting from his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy's right&mdash;a man would never have thought of the like of that&mdash;now,
      would he?&rdquo; said Pete, looking proudly from Philip to the hood, and from
      the hood back to Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip did not answer. Something seemed to be throttling him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when a woman goes away she leaves her eyes behind her, as you might
      say. 'What'll I be getting for them that's at home?' she's thinking, and
      up comes a nice warm lil thing for the baby. Aw, the women's good, Philip.
      They're what they make the sovereigns of, God bless them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip felt as if he must rush out of the house shrieking. One moment he
      stood up before Pete, as though he meant to say something, and then he
      turned to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not sleeping to-night, no? Have to get back to Douglas? Then maybe you'll
      write me a letter first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip nodded his head and returned, his mouth tightly closed, sat down at
      the table, and took up the pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to give you the words, Phil? Yes? Well, if you won't be thinking
      mane&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete charged His pipe out of his waistcoat pocket, and began to dictate:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Dear wife.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      At that Philip gave an involuntary cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, best to begin proper, you know. 'Dear wife,'&rdquo; said Pete again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip made a call on his resolution, and put the words down. His hand
      felt cold; his heart felt frozen to the core. Pete lit up, and walked to
      and fro as he dictated his letter. Nancy sat knitting by the cradle, with
      one foot on the rocker.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;'Glad to get your welcome letter, darling, and the bonnet
     for the baby'&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Go on,&rdquo; said Philip, in an impassive voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got that down, Philip? Aw, you're smart wonderful with the pen,
      though....
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'When she's got it on her lil head you'd laugh tremenjous.
     She's straight like a lil John the Baptist in the church
     window'&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Pete paused; Philip lifted his pen and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done already? Man veen, there's no houlding you....
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'Glad to hear you're so happy and comfortable with Uncle Joe
     and Auntie Joney. Give the pair of them my fond love and
     best respects. We're getting on beautiful, and I'm as happy
     as a sandboy. Sometimes Grannie gets a bit down with
     longing, and so does Nancy, but I tell them you'll be home
     for their funeral sarmon, anyway, and then they're comforted
     wonderful.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be writing his rubbage and lies, your Honour,&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chut! woman; where's the harm at all? A merry touch to keep a person's
      spirits up when she's away from home&mdash;eh, Philip?&rdquo; and Pete appealed
      to him with a nudge at his writing elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip gave no sign. With a look of stupor he was staring down at the
      paper as he wrote. Pete puffed and went on&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;'Cæsar's at it still, going through the Bible same as a
     trawl-boat, fishing up the little texes. The Dempster's
     putting a sight on us reg'lar, and you're not forgot at him
     neither. 'Deed no, but thinking of you constant, and
     trusting you're the better for laving home&mdash;&mdash;-'
</pre>
    <p>
      ... Going too fast, am I? So I'm bating you at last, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cold perspiration had broken out on Philip's forehead, and he was
      looking up with the eyes of a hunted dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to&mdash;must I write that?&rdquo; he said in a helpless way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coorse&mdash;go ahead,&rdquo; said Pete, puffing clouds of smoke, and laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip wrote it. His hand was now stiff. It sprawled and splashed over the
      paper.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;'As for myself, I'm a sort of a grass-widow, and if you
     keep me without a wife much longer they'll be taxing me for
     a bachelor.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Pete put his pipe on the mantelpiece, cleared his throat repeatedly, and
      began to be afflicted with a cough.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;'Glad to hear you're coming home soon, darling (<i>cough</i>).
     Dearest Kirry, I'm missing you mortal (<i>cough</i>), worse nor
     at Kimberley (<i>cough</i>). When I'm going to bed, 'Where is she
     to-night?' I'm saying. And when I'm getting up, 'Where is
     she now?' I'm thinking. And in the dark midnight I'm asking
     myself, 'Is she asleep, I wonder?' (<i>Cough, cough</i>.) Come
     home quick, bogh; but not before you're well at all.'
</pre>
    <p>
      ... Never do to fetch her too soon, you know,&rdquo; he said in a whisper over
      Philip's shoulder, with another nudge at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip answered incoherently, and shrank under Pete's touch as if he had
      been burnt. The coughing continued; the dictating began again.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     '&ldquo;I'm keeping a warm nest for you here, love. There'll be a
     welcome from everybody, and nobody saying anything but the
     good and the kind. So come home soon, my true lil wife,
     before the foolish ould heart of your husband is losing
     him'&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Pete coughed violently, and stretched his neck and mouth awry. &ldquo;This cough
      I've got in my neck is fit to tear me in pieces,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A spoonful of
      cold pinjane, Nancy&mdash;it's ter'ble good to soften the neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy was nodding over the cradle&mdash;she had fallen asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip had turned white and giddy and sick. For one moment an awful
      impulse seized him. He wanted to fall on Pete; to lay hold of him, to
      choke him. The consciousness of his own inferiority, his own duplicity,
      made him hate Pete. The very sweetness of the man sickened him. He could
      not help it&mdash;the last spark of his self-pride was fighting for its
      life. Then in shame, in remorse, in horror of himself and dread of
      everything, he threw down the pen, caught up his hat, shouted &ldquo;Good night&rdquo;
       in a voice like the growl of a beast in terror, and ran out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy started up from a doze. &ldquo;Goodness grazhers!&rdquo; she cried, and the
      cradle rocked violently under her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's that tender-hearted and sympathising,&rdquo; whispered Pete as he closed
      the door. (<i>Cough, cough</i>)... &ldquo;The letter's finished, though&mdash;and
      here's the envelope.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following evening the Deemster was in his rooms in Athol Street. His
      hat was on, his cloak was over his arm, he was resting his elbow on the
      sash of the window and looking vacantly into the churchyard. Jem was
      behind him, answering at his back. Their voices were low; they scarcely
      moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All well upstairs?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well, your Honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More cheerful and content?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much more, except when your Honour is from home. 'The Deemster's back,'
      she'll say, and her poor face will be like sunshine on a rainy day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip remained silent for a moment, and then said in a scarcely audible
      voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not fretting so much about the child, Jemmy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as anxious to hear of it, though. 'Has he been to Ramsey to-day? Did
      he see her? Is she well?' That's the word constant, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Deemster was silent again, and Jem was withdrawing with a deep bow.
      &ldquo;Jemmy, I'm going to Government House, and may be late. Don't wait up for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jem answered in a half whisper, &ldquo;Some one waits up for your Honour whether
      I do or not 'He's at home now,' she'll say, and then creep away to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip muttered, thickly and huskily, &ldquo;The decanter is empty&mdash;leave
      out another bottle.&rdquo; Then he turned to go from the room, keeping his eyes
      from his servant's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the Governor as violent as before, and eager to fall on him
      before he had time to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me. Deemster, that the leader of this rising is a sort of
      left-hand relative of yours. Surely you can stop the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've tried to, your Excellency, and failed,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor tossed up his chin. &ldquo;I'm told the fellow can't even write his
      own name,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's true,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An illiterate and utterly uneducated person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same, he's the wisest and strongest man on this island,&rdquo; said
      Philip decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor frowned, and the pockmarks on his forehead seemed to swell.
      &ldquo;The wisest and strongest man on this island will have to leave it,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip made no answer. He had come to plead, but he saw that it was
      hopeless. The Governor put his right hand in the breast, of his white
      waistcoat&mdash;he was alone in the dining-room after dinner&mdash;and
      darted at Philip a look of anger and command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deemster,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if, as you say, you cannot stop this low-bred
      rascal, there's one thing you can do&mdash;leave him to himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say,&rdquo; said Philip out of a corner of his mouth, &ldquo;to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me be it, and who has more right?&rdquo; said the Governor hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip held himself in hand. He was silent, and his silence was taken for
      submission. Cracking some nuts and munching them, the Governor began to
      take another tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be sorry, Mr. Christian, if anything came between you and me&mdash;very
      sorry. We've been good friends thus far, and you will allow that you owe
      me something. Don't you see it yourself&mdash;this man is dishonouring me
      in the eyes of the island? If you have tried your best to keep his neck
      out of the halter, let the consequences be his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Philip, with his eyes on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done your duty by the man, I say. Help yourself to a glass of
      wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Philip did not speak. The Governor saw his advantage, but little did
      he guess the pitiless power of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fellow is your kinsman, Deemster, and I shall not ask you to deal
      with him. That would be inhuman. If there is no hope of restraining him
      to-morrow&mdash;wise as he is, if he will not listen to saner counsels, I
      will only beg of you&mdash;but this is a matter for the police. You are a
      high official now. It would be a pity to give you pain. Stay at home&mdash;I'll
      gladly excuse you&mdash;you look as if a day's rest would do you good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip drank two glasses of the wine in quick succession. The Governor
      poured him a third, and went on&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what you're feeling for the man may be&mdash;it can't be
      friendship. I'm sure he's a thorn in your flesh. And as long as he's here
      he will always be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip looked up with inquiry, doubt, and fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I knew it. Even if this matter goes by, your time will come. You'll
      quarrel with the fellow yet&mdash;you know you will&mdash;it's in the
      nature of things&mdash;if he's the man you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip drank the third glass of wine and rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave him to me&mdash;I'll deal with him. You'll be done with him, and a
      good riddance, too, I reckon. And now come in to the ladies&mdash;they'll
      know you're here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip excused himself and went off with feverish gestures and an excited
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Governor is right,&rdquo; he thought, as he went home over the dark roads.
      Pete was a thorn in his flesh, and always would be; his enemy, his
      relentless enemy, notwithstanding his love for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The misery of the past month could not be supported any longer. Perpetual
      fear of discovery, perpetual guard of the tongue, keeping watch and ward
      on every act of life&mdash;to-day, to-morrow, the next day, on and on
      until life's end in wretchedness or disgrace&mdash;it was insupportable,
      it was impossible, it could not be attempted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came thoughts that were too fearful to take form-too awful to take
      words. They were like the flapping of unseen wings going by him in the
      night, but the meaning of them was this: If Pete persists in his purpose,
      there will be a riot. If any one is injured, Pete will be transported. If
      any one is killed, Pete will be indicted for his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have done my duty by him,&rdquo; his heart whimpered. &ldquo;I have tried to
      restrain him. I have tried to restrain the Governor. It isn't my fault.
      What more can I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip walked fast. Here was the way of escape from the evil that beset
      his path. Fate was stretching out her hands to him. When men had done
      wrong, they did yet more wrong to elude the consequences of their first
      fault; but there was no need for that in his case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour was late. A strong breeze was blowing off the sea. It flicked his
      face with salt as he went swinging down the hill into the town. His blood
      was a-fire. He had a feeling, never felt before, of courage and even
      ferocity. Something told him that he was not so good a man as he had been,
      but it was a tingling pleasure to feel that he was a stronger man than
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should he tell Kate? No! Let the thing go on; let it end. After it was
      over she would see where their account lay. Thinking in this way, he
      laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town was quiet when he came to it. So absorbed had he been that,
      though the air was sharp, he had been carrying his cloak over his arm. Now
      he put it on, and drew the hood close over his head. A dog, a homeless
      cur, had begun to follow at his heels. He drove it off, but it continued
      to hang about him. At last it got in front of his feet, and he stumbled
      over it in one of his large, quick strides. Then he kicked the dog, and it
      crossed the dark street yelping. He was a worse man, and he knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He let himself into the house with his latch-key, and banged the door
      behind his back. But no sooner had he breathed the soft, woolly, stagnant
      air within than a change came over him. His ferocious strength ebbed away,
      and he began to tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hall passage and staircase were in darkness. This was by his orders&mdash;coming
      in late, he always forgot to put out the gas. But the lamp of his room was
      burning on the candle rest at the stairhead, and it cast a long sword of
      light down the staircase well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilled by some unknown fear, he had set one foot on the first tread when
      he thought he heard the step of some one coming down the stairs. It was a
      familiar step. He was sure he knew it. It must be a step he heard daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, and the step seemed to stop also. At that moment there was a
      shuffling of slippered feet on an upper landing, and Jem-y-Lord called
      down, &ldquo;Is it you, your Honour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an effort he answered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is anything the matter?&rdquo; called the man-servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's somebody coming downstairs, isn't there?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody coming downstairs?&rdquo; repeated the man-servant, and the light
      shifted as if he were lifting the lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you coming down, Jem?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me coming down? I'm here, holding the lamp, your Honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another of my fancies,&rdquo; thought Philip; and he laid hold of the handrail,
      and started afresh. The step came on. He knew it now; it was his own step.
      &ldquo;An echo,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;A dream,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;a mirage of the mind;&rdquo;
       and he compelled himself to go up. The step came down. It passed him on
      the stairs, going by the wall as he went by the rail, with an irresistible
      down-drive, headlong, heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came one of those moments of partial unconsciousness in which the
      sensation of a sound takes shape. It seemed to Philip that the figure of a
      man had passed him. He remembered it instantly. It was the same that he
      had seen in the lobby to the Council Chamber, his own figure, but wrapped
      in a cloak like the one he was then wearing, and with the hood drawn over
      the head. The body had been half turned aside, the face had been hidden,
      and the whole form had expressed contempt, repugnance, and loathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not well to-night, your Honour?&rdquo; said the far-off voice of Jem-y-Lord. He
      was holding the dazzling lamp up to the Deemster's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little faint&mdash;that's all. Go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Philip was alone in his room. &ldquo;Conscience!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Pete may go,
      but <i>this</i> will be with me to the end. Which, O God?&mdash;which?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He poured out half a tumbler from the bottle on the table, and gulped it
      down at a draught. At the same moment he heard a light foot overhead. It
      was a woman's foot; it crossed the floor, and then ceased.

    <h2>
      IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next morning the Deemster was still sleeping while the sun was shining
      into his room. He was awakened by a thunderous clamour, which came as from
      a nail driven into the back of his head. Opening his eyes, he realised
      that somebody was knocking at his door, and shouting in a robustious bass&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christian, I say! Ever going to get up at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the Clerk of the Rolls. Under one of his heavy poundings the catch
      of the door gave way, and he stepped into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Degenerate Manxman!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;In bed on Tynwald morning. Pooh! this
      room smells of dead sleep, dead spirits, and dead everything. Let me get
      at that window&mdash;you pitch your clothes all over the floor. Ah! that's
      fresher! Headache? I should think so. Get up, then, and I'll drive you to
      St. John's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't think I'll go to-day, sir,&rdquo; said Philip in a feeble whimper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not go? Holy saints! Judge of his island and not go to Tynwald! What will
      the Governor say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said last night he would excuse my absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse your fiddlesticks! The air will do you good. I've got the carriage
      below. Listen! it's striking ten by the church. I'll give you fifteen
      minutes, and step into your breakfast-room and look over the <i>Times</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Clerk rolled out, and then Philip heard his loud voice through the
      door in conversation with Jem-y-Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how's Mrs. Cottier to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Middling, sir, thank you, sir.''
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't let us see too much of her, Jemmy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not been well since coming to Douglas, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cups and saucers rattled, the newspaper creaked, the Clerk cleared his
      throat, and there was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip rose with a heavy heart, still in the torment of his great
      temptation. He remembered the vision of the night before, and, broad
      morning as it was, he trembled. In the Isle of Man such visions are
      understood to foretell death, and the man who sees them is said to &ldquo;see
      his soul.&rdquo; But Philip had no superstitions. He knew what the vision was:
      he knew what the vision meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jem-y-Lord came in with hot water, and Philip, without looking round, said
      in a low tone as the door closed, &ldquo;How now, my lad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fretting again, your Honour,&rdquo; said the man, in a half whisper. He busied
      himself in the room a moment, and then added, &ldquo;Somehow she gets to know
      things. Yesterday evening now&mdash;I was taking down some of the bottles,
      and I met her on the stairs. Next time I saw her she was crying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip said in a confused way, fumbling the razor. &ldquo;Tell her I intend to
      see her after Tynwald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, your Honour. 'It's not that, Mr. Cottier,' she answered me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wig and gown to-day, Jemmy,&rdquo; said Philip, and he went out in his robes
      as Deemster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was bright, and the streets were thronged with vehicles. Brakes,
      wagonettes, omnibuses, private carriages, and cadger's carts all loaded to
      their utmost, were climbing out of Douglas by way of the road to Peel. The
      town seemed to shout; the old island rock itself seemed to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, Christian,&rdquo; said the Clerk of the Rolls, looking at his watch,
      &ldquo;do you know it's half-past ten? Service begins at eleven. Drive on,
      coachman. You've eight miles to do in half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't go any faster with this traffic on the road, sir,&rdquo; said the
      coachman over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got so absorbed in the newspaper,&rdquo; said the Clerk, &ldquo;that&mdash;&mdash;
      Well, if we're late, we're late, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip folded his arms across his breast and hung his head. He was
      fighting a great battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No idea that the fisherman affair was going to be so serious,&rdquo; said the
      Clerk. &ldquo;It seems the Governor has ordered out every soldier and pensioner.
      If I know my countrymen, they'll not stand much of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip drew a long breath: there was a cloud of dust; the women in the
      brakes were laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear a whisper that the ringleader is a friend of yours, Christian&mdash;'an
      irregular relative of a high official,' as the reporter says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is my cousin, sir,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? The big, curly-pated fellow you took home in the carriage?... I
      say, coachman, no need to drive <i>quite</i> so fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip's head was still down. The Clerk of the Rolls sat watching him with
      an anxious face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christian, I am not so sure the Governor wasn't right after all. Is this
      what's been troubling you for a month? You're the deuce for a secret. If
      there's anything good to tell, you're up like the sun; but if there's bad
      news going, an owl is a poll-parrot compared with you for talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip made some feeble effort to laugh, and to say his head was still
      aching. They were on the breast of the steep hill going up to Greeba. The
      road ahead was like a funnel of dust; the road behind was like the tail of
      a comet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pity a fine lad like that should get into trouble,&rdquo; said the Clerk. &ldquo;I
      like the rascal. He got round an old man's heart like a rope round a
      capstan. One of the big, hearty dogs that make you say, 'By Jove, and I'm
      a Manxman, too.' He's in the right in this affair, whatever the Governor
      may say. And the Governor knows it, Christian&mdash;that's why he's so
      anxious to excuse you. He can overawe the Keys; and as for the Council,
      we're paid our wages, God bless us, and are so many stuffed snipes on his
      stick. But you&mdash;you're different. Then the man is your kinsman, and
      blood is thicker than water, if it's only&mdash;&mdash; Why, what's this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was some whooping behind; the line of carriages swirled like a long
      serpent half a yard near the hedge, and through the grey dust a large
      covered car shot by at the gallop of a fire-engine. The Clerk-sat bolt
      upright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what in the name of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's an ambulance waggon,&rdquo; said Philip between his set teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later a second waggon went galloping past, then a third, and
      finally a fourth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, upon my&mdash;&mdash; Ah! good day. Doctor! Good day, good day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Clerk had recognised friends on the waggons, and was returning their
      salutations. When they were gone, he first looked at Philip, and then
      shouted, &ldquo;Coachman, right about face. We're going home again&mdash;and
      chance it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't be turning here, sir,&rdquo; said the coachman. &ldquo;The vehicles are
      coming up like bees going a-swarming. We'll have to go as far as Tynwald,
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Philip in a determined voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while the Clerk said, &ldquo;Christian, it isn't worth while getting
      into trouble over this affair. After all, the Governor is the Governor.
      Besides, he's been a good friend to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was passing through a purgatorial fire, and his old master was
      feeding it with fuel on every side. They were nearing Tynwald, and could
      see the flags, the tents, and the crowd as of a vast encampment, and hear
      the deep hum of a multitude, like the murmur of a distant sea.

    <h2>
      X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tynwald Hill is the ancient Parliament ground of Man. It is an open green
      in the midst of the island, with hills on three of its sides, and on the
      fourth a broad plain dipping to the coast. This green is of the shape of a
      guitar. Down the middle of the guitar there is a walled enclosure of the
      shape of a banjo. At the end stands a church. The round drum is the mount,
      which has four circles, the topmost being some six paces across.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage containing the Deemster and the Clerk of the Bolls had drawn
      up at the west gate of the church, and a policeman had opened the door.
      There came the sound of singing from the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A quarter late,&rdquo; said the Clerk of the Rolls, consulting his watch.
      &ldquo;Shall we go in, your Honor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us take a turn round the fair instead,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage door was shut back, and they began to move over the green.
      The open part of it was covered with booths, barrows, stands, and
      show-tents. There were cheap jacks with shoddy watches, phrenologists with
      two chairs, fat women, dwarfs, wandering minstrels, itinerant hawkers of
      toffee in tin hat-boxes, and other shiny and slimy creatures with the air
      and grease of the towns. There were a few oxen and horses also, tethered
      and lanketted, and kicking up the dust under the dry turf.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd was dense already, and increasing at every moment. As the brakes
      arrived, they drove up with a swing that sent the people surging on either
      side. Some brought well-behaved visitors, others brought an eruption of
      ruffians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the neck of the enclosure, and round the circular end of it, stood a
      regiment of soldiers with rifles and bayonets. The steps to the mount were
      laid down with rushes. Two armchairs were on the top, under a canopy hung
      from a flagstaff that stood in the centre. These chairs were still empty,
      and the mount and its approaches were kept clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was overhead, the heat was great, the odour was oppressive. Now
      and again the sound of the service within the church mingled with the crack
      of the toy rifle-ranges and the jabber of the cheap jacks. At length there
      was another sound&mdash;a more portentous sound&mdash;the sound of bands
      playing in the distance. It came from both south and west, from the
      direction of Peel, and from that of Port St. Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're coming,&rdquo; said the Clerk, and Philip's face, when he turned his
      head to listen, quivered and grew yet more pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the bands approached they ceased to play. Presently a vast procession
      of men from the west came up in silence to the skirt of the hill, and
      turned off in the direction from which the men from the south were seen to
      be coming. They were in jerseys and sea-boots, marching four deep, and
      carrying nothing in their brawny hands. One stalwart fellow walked firmly
      at the head of them.. It was Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip could support the strain no longer. He got out of the carriage. The
      Clerk of the Rolls got out also, and followed him as he walked with
      wavering, irregular steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under a great tree at the junction of three roads, the two companies of
      fishermen met and fell into a general throng. There was a low wall around
      the tree-trunk, and, standing on this, Pete's head was clear above the
      rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;there's three hundred armed soldiers on the hill
      yonder, with twenty rounds of ball-cartridge apiece. You're going to the
      Coort because you've a right to go. You're going up peaceable, and, when
      you're getting there, you're going to mix among the soldiers, three to
      every man, two on either side and one behind. Then your spokesmen are
      going to spake out your complaint. If they're listened to, you're wanting
      no better. But if they're not, and if the word is given to fire on them,
      then, before there's time to do it, you're going to stretch every man of
      the three hundred on his back and take his weapon. Don't hurt the soldiers&mdash;the
      poor soldiers are only doing what they're tould. But don't let the
      soldiers hurt you neither. You're going there for justice. You're not
      going there to fight. But if anybody fights you, let him never forget the
      day he done it. Break up every taffy stand in the fair, if you can't find
      anything better. And if blood is shed, lave the man that orders it to me.
      And now go up, boys, like men and like Manxmen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no cheering, no shouting, no clapping of hands. Only broken
      exclamations and a sort of confused murmur. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; whispered the Clerk of
      the Rolls, putting his hand through Philip's quivering arm. &ldquo;Little does
      the poor devil think that, if blood is shed, he will be the first to
      fall.&rdquo; &ldquo;God in heaven!&rdquo; muttered Philip.

    <h2>
      XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The crowd on Tynwald had now gathered thick down the neck of the enclosure
      and dense round the mount. To the strains of the National Anthem, played
      by the band of the regiment, the Governor had come out of the church. He
      was in cocked hat and with sword, and the sword of state was carried
      upright before him. With his Keys, Council, and clergy, he walked to the
      hill-top. There he took one of the two chairs under the canopy; the other,
      was taken by the Bishop in his lawn. Their followers came behind, and
      broke up on the hill into an indiscriminate mass. A number of ladies were
      admitted to the space on the topmost round. They stood behind the chairs,
      with their parasols still open.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are men that the densest crowd will part and make way for. The crowd
      had parted and made way for Philip. As the court was being &ldquo;fenced,&rdquo; he
      appeared with his companion at the foot of the mount. There he was
      recognised by many, but he scarcely answered their salutations. The
      Governor made a deferential bow, smiled, and beckoned to him to come up to
      his side. He went up slowly, pausing at every other step, like a man who
      was in doubt if he ought to go higher. At length he stood at the
      Governor's right hand, with all eyes upon him, for the favourite of the
      great is favoured. He was then the highest figure on the mount, the
      Governor and the Bishop being seated. The people could see him from end to
      side of the Tynwald, and he could see the people as they stood closely
      packed on the green below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The business of the Court began. It was that of promulgating the laws.
      Philip's senior colleague, the old Deemster of the happy face, read the
      titles of the laws in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Coroner of the premier sheading began to recite the same titles
      in Manx. Nobody heard them; hardly anybody listened. The ladies on the
      mount chatted among themselves, the Keys and the clergy intermingled and
      talked, the officials of the Council looked at the crowd, and the crowd
      itself, having nothing to hear, no more to see, indifferent to doings they
      could not understand, resumed their amusements among the frivolities of
      the fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were three persons in that assembly of fifteen thousand who were
      following the course of events with feverish interest. The first of these
      was the Governor, whose restless eyes were rolling from side to side with
      almost savage light; the second was the captain of the regiment, who was
      watching the Governor's face for a signal; the third was Philip, who was
      looking down at the crowd and seeing something that had meaning for
      himself alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fishermen came up quietly, three thousand strong. Half a hundred of
      them lounged around the magazine&mdash;the ammunition was at their
      command. The rest pushed, edged, and elbowed their way through the people
      until they came to the line of the guard. Wherever there was a red coat,
      behind it there were three jerseys and stocking-caps, Philip saw it all
      from his elevation on the mount. His face was deadly pale, his eyelids
      wavered, his lower lip trembled, his hand twitched; when he was spoken to,
      he hardly answered; he was like a man holding counsel with himself, and
      half in fear that everybody could read his hidden thoughts. He was in the
      last throes of his temptation. The decisive moment was near. It was heavy
      with the fate of his after life. He thought of Pete and the torture of his
      company; of Kate and the unending misery of her existence; of himself and
      the deep duplicity to which he was committed. From all this he could be
      freed for ever&mdash;by what? By doing nothing, having already done his
      duty? Only let him command himself, and then&mdash;relief from an
      existence enthralled by torment&mdash;from constant alarm and watchfulness&mdash;peace&mdash;sleep&mdash;love&mdash;Kate!
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody was speaking to him over his shoulder. It was nothing&mdash;only
      the quip of a witty fellow, descendant of a Spanish freebooter. Ladies
      caught his eye, smiled and bowed to him. A little man, whose swarthy face
      showed African blood, reached up and quoted something about the bounds of
      freedom wide and wider.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Coroner had finished, the proceedings were at an end&mdash;there was a
      movement&mdash;something had happened&mdash;the Governor had half risen
      from his chair. Twelve men in sea-boots and blue jerseys had passed the
      line of the guard, and were standing midway across the steps of the mount.
      One of them was beginning to speak. It was Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Governor,&rdquo; he said; but the captain of the regiment was abreast of him in
      a moment, and a score of the soldiers were about his companions at the
      next breath. The fishermen stood their ground like a wall, and the
      soldiers fell back. There was hardly any scuffle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Governor,&rdquo; said Pete again, touching his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor was twisting in his seat. Looking first at Pete, and then at
      the captain, he was in the act of lifting his hand when suddenly it was
      held by another hand at his side, and a low voice whispered at his ear,
      &ldquo;No, sir; for God's sake, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Philip. The Governor looked at him with amazement. &ldquo;What do you
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said Philip, still whispering over him hotly and impetuously,
      &ldquo;that there's only one way back to Government House, but if you lift your
      hand it will be one too many; I mean that if blood is shed you'll never
      live to leave this mount; I mean that your three hundred soldiers are only
      as three hundred rabbits in the claws of three thousand crows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the next instant he had left the Governor, and was face to face with
      the fishermen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fishermen,&rdquo; he cried, lifting both hands before him, &ldquo;let there be no
      trouble here to-day, no riot, for God's sake, no bloodshed. Listen to me.
      I am the grandson of a fisherman; I have been a fisherman myself; I love
      the fishermen. As long as I live I will stand by you. Your rights shall be
      my rights, your sins my sins, and where you go I will go too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, swinging back to the Governor, he bowed low, and said in a
      deferential voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Excellency, these men mean no harm; they wish to speak to you; they
      have a petition to make; they will be loyal and peaceable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Governor, having recovered from his first fear, was now in a flame
      of anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, with the accent of authority; &ldquo;this is no time and no place
      for petitions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, your Excellency,&rdquo; said Philip, with a deeper bow; &ldquo;this is
      the time of all times, the place of all places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There had been a general surging of the Keys and clergy towards the steps,
      and now one of them cried out of their group, &ldquo;Is Tynwald Court to be
      turned into a bear-garden?&rdquo; And another said in a cynical voice, &ldquo;Perhaps
      your Excellency has taken somebody else's seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip raised himself to his full height, and answered, with his eyes on
      the speakers, &ldquo;We are free-born men on this island, your Excellency. We
      did not come to Tynwald to learn order from the grandson of a Spanish
      pirate, or freedom from the son of a black chief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hould hard, boys!&rdquo; cried Pete, lifting one hand against his followers, as
      if to keep them quiet. He was boiling with a desire to shout till his
      throat should crack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor had exchanged rapid looks and low whispers with the captain.
      He saw that he was outwitted, that he was helpless, that he was even in
      personal danger. The captain was biting his leg with vexation that he had
      not reckoned more seriously with this rising&mdash;that he had not drawn
      up his men in column.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Excellency will hear the fishermen?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; said the Governor. He was at least a brave man, if a vain
      and foolish one.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment. Then, standing erect, and making an effort
      to control himself, Philip said, &ldquo;May it please your Excellency, you fill
      a proud position here; you are the ruler of this island under your
      sovereign lady our Queen. But we, your subjects, your servants, are in a
      prouder position still. We are Manxmen. This is the Court of our country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hould hard,&rdquo; cried Pete again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a thousand years men with our blood and our names have stood on this
      hill to hear the voice of the people, and to do justice between man and
      man. That's what the place was meant for. If it has lost that meaning,
      root it up&mdash;it is a show and a sham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; cried Pete; he could hold himself in no longer, and his word was
      taken up with a shout, both on the hill and on the green beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip's voice had risen to a shrill cry, but it was low and meek as he
      added, bowing yet lower while he spoke&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Excellency will hear the fishermen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor rolled in his seat. &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men made their petition. Three or four of them spoke briefly and to
      the point. They had had harbours, their fathers' harbours, which had been
      freed to them forty years before; don't ask them to pay harbour dues until
      proper harbours were provided:
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor gave his promise. Then he rose, the band struck up &ldquo;God save
      the Queen,&rdquo; and the Legislature filed back to the chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip went with them. He had fought a great battle, and he had prevailed.
      Through purging fires the real man had emerged, but he had paid the price
      of his victory. His eye burned like live coal, his cheek-bones seemed to
      have upheaved. He walked alone; his ancient colleague had stepped ahead of
      him. But now and again, as he passed down the long path to the
      church-door, fishermen and farmers pushed between the rifles of the
      guards, and said in husky voices, &ldquo;Let me shake you by the hand,
      Dempster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The scene was repeated with added emotion half an hour afterwards, when,
      the court being adjourned and the Governor gone in ominous silence, Philip
      came out, white and smiling, and leaning on the arm of his old master, the
      Clerk of the Rolls. He could scarcely tear himself through the thick-set
      hedge of people that lined the path to the gate. As he got into the
      carriage his smile disappeared. Sinking into the seat, he buried himself
      in the corner and dropped his head on his breast. The people began to
      cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive on,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cheering became loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive, drive,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people cheered yet louder. They thought that they had seen a grand
      triumph that day&mdash;a man triumphing over the Governor. But there had
      been a grander triumph which they had not seen&mdash;a man triumphing over
      himself. Only one saw that, and it was God.

    <h2>
      XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pete seemed to be beside himself. He laughed until he cried; he cried
      until he laughed. His resonant voice rang out everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear him? My gough, it was like a bugle spaking. There's nobody can spake
      but himself. When the others are toot-tooting, it's just 'Polly, put the
      kettle on' (mimicking a mincing treble). See the lil Puffin on his throne
      of turf there? Looked as if Ould Nick had been thrashing peas on his face
      for a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete's enthusiasm rose to frenzy, and he began to sweep through the fair,
      bemoaning his country and pouring mouth-fuls of anathema on his
      countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mannin veg villish</i> (sweet little Isle of Man), with your English
      Governors and your English Bishops, and boys of your own worth ten of
      them. <i>Manninee graihagh</i> (beloved Manxmen), you're driving them away
      to be Bishops for others and Governors abroad&mdash;and yourselves going
      to the dogs and the divil, and d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete's prophetic mood dropped to a jovial one. He bought the remaining
      stock-in-trade of an itinerant toffee-seller, and hammered the lid of the
      tin hat-box to beat up the children. They followed him like hares hopping
      in the snow; and he distributed his bounty in inverse relation to size, a
      short stick to a big lad, a long stick to a little one, and two sticks to
      a girl. The results were an infantile war. Here, a damsel of ten squaring
      her lists to fight a hulking fellow of twelve for her sister of six; and
      there, a mother wiping the eyes of her boy of five, and whispering &ldquo;Hush,
      bogh; hush! You shall have the bladder when we kill the pig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete began to drink. &ldquo;How do, Faddy? Taking joy of you, Juan. Are you in
      life, Thom! Half a glass of rum will do no harm, boys. Not the drink at
      all&mdash;just the good company, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hailed the women also, but they were less willing to be treated. &ldquo;I'd
      have more respect for my quarterly ticket, sir,&rdquo; said Betsy&mdash;she was
      a Primitive, with her husband on the &ldquo;Planbeg.&rdquo; &ldquo;There's a hole in your
      pocket, Capt'n; stop it up with your fist, man,&rdquo; said Liza&mdash;she was a
      gombeen woman, and when she got a penny in her hand it was a prisoner for
      life. &ldquo;Chut! woman,&rdquo; said Pete, &ldquo;what's the good book say ing? 'Riches
      have wings;' let the birds fly then,&rdquo; and off he went, reeling and
      tottering, and laughing his formidable laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete grew merry. Rooting up the remains of the fishermen's band, he hired
      them to accompany him through the fair. They were three little musicians,
      now exceedingly drunk, and their duty was to play &ldquo;Hail, Isle of Man,&rdquo; as
      he went swaggering along in front of them.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Hail, Isle of Man,
     Swate ocean lan',
          I love thy sea-girt border.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play up, Jackie.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;The barley sown,
     Potatoes down,
          We'll get our boats in order.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Thus he forged through the fair, capering, laughing, shouting protests
      over his shoulder when the tipsy music failed, pretending to be very
      drunk, trying to show that he was carrying on, that he was going it, that
      he hadn't a second thought, but watching everything for all that, studying
      every face, and listening to the talk of everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whips of money at him, Liza&mdash;whips of it&mdash;millions, they're
      saying.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He's spending it like flitters then. The Manx chaps isn't
      fit for fortunes&mdash;no, they aren't. I wonder in the world what sort of
      wife there's at him. <i>I</i> don't 'low my husband the purse. Three
      ha'pence is enough to be giving any man at once.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Wife, you're
      saying? Don't you know, woman?&rdquo; Then some whispering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bass, boy&mdash;more bass, I tell thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;We then sought nex'
     The soothing sex,
          Our swatearts at Port Erin.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who <i>is</i> the man at all?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Why, Capt'n Quilliam from
      Kimberley.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;'Deed, man! Him that married with some of the Cæsar
      Glenmooar's ones?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;She's left him, though, and gone off with a
      wastrel.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You don't say?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, I saw the young woman myself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;At Quiggin's Hall
     There's enough for all,
          Good beer, and all things proper.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hould,boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete had drawn up suddenly, and stopped his musicians with a sweep of the
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you spaking, Mr. Corteen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, Capt'n. No need to stare at all. I was only saying I was at the
      camp-meeting at Sulby, and I saw&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Jackie.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;A pleasant place,
     With beds of aise,
          When we are done our supper.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The unhappy man was deceiving himself at least as much as anybody else.
      After looking for the light of intelligence in every face, waiting for a
      word, watching for a glance, expecting every moment that some one from
      south or north, or east or west, would say, &ldquo;I've seen her;&rdquo; yet, covering
      up the burning coal of his anxiety with the ashes of mock merriment, he
      tried to persuade himself that Kate was not on the island if nobody at
      Tynwald had seen her; that he had told the truth unwittingly, and that he
      was as happy as the day was long.

    <h2>
      XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A man in a gig came driving a long-horned cow in front of him. Driver,
      horse, gig, and cow were like animated shapes of dust, but Pete recognised
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it yourself, Cæsar? So you're for selling ould Horney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grieved in my heart I am to do it, sir. Many a good glass of milk she has
      given to me and mine,&rdquo; and Cæsar was ready to weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going falling in fits, isn't she, Cæsar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, man! hush, man!&rdquo; said Cæsar, looking about. &ldquo;A good cow, very; but
      down twice since I left home this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd give a bad sixpence to see Cæsar selling that cow,&rdquo; thought Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three men were bargaining over a horse. Two were selling, the third (it
      was Black Tom) was buying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rising five years, sir. Sired by Mahomet. Oh, I've got the papers to
      prove it,&rdquo; said one of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, man? Five?&rdquo; shouted Black Tom down the horse's open mouth. &ldquo;She'll
      never see eight the longest day she lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use decaiving the man,&rdquo; said the other dealer, speaking in Manx.
      &ldquo;She's sixteen&mdash;'low she's nine, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair play, boys; spake English before a poor fellow,&rdquo; said Black Tom,
      with a snort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This brother of mine lows she's seven,&rdquo; said the first of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thundering liar,&rdquo; said Black Tom in Manx. &ldquo;He says she's sixteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dealing ponies then?&rdquo; asked Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything, sir; anything. Buying for farmers up Lonan way,&rdquo; said Black
      Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;here's Cæsar with a long-horned cow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They found the good man tethering a white, long-horned cow to the wheel of
      the tipped-up gig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do, Cæsar? And how much for the long-horn?&rdquo; said Black Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, look at the base (beast), Mr. Quilliam. Examine her for yourself,&rdquo;
       said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Middling fair ewer, good quarter, five calves&mdash;is it five, Cæsar?&rdquo;
       said Black Tom, holding one of the long horns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three, sir, and calving again for February.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No milk fever? No? Kicks a bit at milking? Never? Fits? Ever had fits,
      Cæsar?&rdquo; opening wide one of the cow's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you known me these years for a dacent man, Mr. Quilliam&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       began Cæsar in an injured tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what's the figure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fourteen pound, sir! and she'll take the road before I'll go home with a
      pound less!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fourteen&mdash;what! Ten; I'll give you ten&mdash;not a penny more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day to <i>you</i>, Mr. Quilliam,&rdquo; said Cæsar. Then, as if by an
      afterthought, &ldquo;You're an ould friend of mine, Thomas; a very ould friend,
      Tom&mdash;I'll split you the diff'rance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Break a straw on it,&rdquo; said Black Tom; and the transaction was complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had a clane strike here&mdash;the base is worth fifteen,&rdquo; chuckled
      Black Tom in Pete's ear as he drove the cow in to a shed beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be buying another cow in place of poor ould Horney,&rdquo; whispered
      Cæsar as he dived into the cattle stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike up, Jackie,&rdquo; shouted Pete.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;West of the mine,
     The day being fine.
          The tide against us veering.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later Pete heard a fearful clamour, which drowned the noise
      that he himself was making. Within the shed the confusion of tongues was
      terrific.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this at all?&rdquo; he asked, crushing through with an innocent face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man's cow has fits,&rdquo; cried Black Tom. &ldquo;I'll have my money back. The
      ould psalm-singing Tommy Noddy! did he think he was lifting the
      collection? My money! My twelve goolden pounds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Black Tom had not been as bald as a bladder, he would have torn his
      hair in his mortification. But Pete pacified him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cæsar is looking for another cow&mdash;sell him his own back again.
      Impozz'ble? Who says it's impozz'ble? Cut off her long horns, and he'll
      never be knowing her from her grandmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Pete made up to Cæsar and said, &ldquo;Tom's got a mailie (hornless) cow to
      sell, and it's the very thing you're wanting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she a good mailie?&rdquo; asked Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten quarts either end of the day, Cæsar, and fifteen pounds of butter a
      week,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's the base, sir?&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met Black Tom leading a hornless, white cow from the shed to the
      green.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you coming together, Peter?&rdquo; he said cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar eyed the cow doubtfully for a moment, and then said briskly, &ldquo;What's
      the price of the mailie, Mr. Quilliam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, look at the base first, Mr. Cregeen. Examine her for yourself, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;well, yes; a middling good base enough. Four calves,
      Thomas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two, sir, and calves again for January. Twenty-four quarts of new milk
      every day of life, and butter fit to burst the churn for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fever at all? No fits? No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, have you known me these teens of years, Mr. Cregeen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what d'ye say&mdash;eleven pounds for the cow, Tom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirteen, Cæsar; and if you warn an ould friend&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hould your hand, Mr. Quilliam; I'm not a man when I've got a bargain....
      Manx notes or the dust, Thomas? Goold? Here you are, then&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four...&rdquo;
       (giving the cow another searching glance across his shoulder). &ldquo;It's
      wonderful, though, the straight she's like ould Horney... five&mdash;six&mdash;seven...
      in colour and size, I mane... eight&mdash;nine&mdash;ten... and if she
      warn a mailie cow, now... eleven&mdash;twelve&mdash;&rdquo; (the money hanging
      from his thumb). &ldquo;Will that be enough, Mr. Quilliam? No? Half a one, then?
      Aw, you're hard, Tom... thirteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having paid the last pound, Cæsar stood a moment contemplating his
      purchase, and then said doubtfully, &ldquo;Well, if I hadn't... Grannie will be
      saying it's the same base back&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo; (the cow began to reel).
      &ldquo;Yes, and it&mdash;no, surely&mdash;a mailie for all&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo; (the
      cow fell). &ldquo;It's got the same fits, anyway,&rdquo; cried Cæsar; and then he
      rushed to the cow's head. &ldquo;It <i>is</i> the same base. The horns are going
      cutting off at her. My money back! Give me my money back&mdash;my thirteen
      yellow sovereigns&mdash;the sweat of my brow!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, no,&rdquo; said Black Tom. &ldquo;There's no money giving back at all. If the cow
      was good enough for you to sell, she's good enough for you to buy,&rdquo; and he
      turned on his heel with a laugh of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar was choking with vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, sir,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;If Tom has taken a mane advantage of you,
      it'll be all set right at the Judgment. You've that satisfaction, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I? No, I haven't,&rdquo; said Cæsar from between his teeth. &ldquo;The man's
      clever. He'll get himself converted before he comes to die, and then
      there'll not be a word about cutting the horns off my cow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike up, Jackie,&rdquo; shouted Pete.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

    <h2>
      XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sky became overcast, rain began to fall, and there was a rush for the
      carts. In half an hour Tynwald Hill was empty, and the people were
      splashing off on every side like the big drops of rain that were pelting
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete hired a brake that was going back to the north, and gathered up his
      friends from Ramsey. When these were seated, there was a rush of helpless
      and abandoned ones who were going in the same direction&mdash;young
      mothers with children, old men and old women. Pete hauled them up till the
      seats and the floor were choked, and the brake could hold no more. He got
      small thanks. &ldquo;Such crushing and scrooging! I declare my black merino
      frock, that I've only had on once, will be teetotal spoilt.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;If
      they don't start soon I'll be taking the neuralgy dreadful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They got started at length, and, at the tail of a line of stiff carts,
      they went rattling over the mountain-road. The harebells nodded their
      washed faces from the hedge, and the talk was brisk and cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our Thorn's sowl a hafer, and got a good price.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What for didn't
      you buy the mare of Corlett Beldroma, Juan?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Did I want to be
      killed as dead as a herring?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Kicks, does she? Bate her, man; bate
      her. A horse is like a woman. If you aren't bating her now and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stopped at every half-way houses&mdash;it was always halfway to
      somewhere. The men got exceedingly drunk and began to sing. At that the
      women grew very angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sakes alive! you're no better than a lot of Cottonies.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Deed, but
      they're worse than any Cottonies, ma'am. Some excuse for the like of <i>them</i>.
      In their cotton-mills all the year, and nothing at home but a piece of
      grass the size of your hand in the backyard, and going hopping on it like
      a lark in a cage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rain came down in torrents, the mountain-path grew steep and desolate,
      the few houses passed were empty and boarded up, gorse bushes hissed to
      the rising breeze, geese scuttled and screamed across the untilled land, a
      solitary black crow flew across the leaden sky, and on the sea outside a
      tall pillar of smoke went stalking on and on, where the pleasure-steamer
      carried her freight of tourists round the island. Then songs gave way to
      sighs, some of the men began to pick quarrels, and some to break into fits
      of drunken sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete kept them all up. He chaffed and laughed and told funny stories.
      Choking, stifling, wounded to the heart as he was, still he was carrying
      on, struggling to convince everybody and himself as well, that nothing was
      amiss, that he was a jolly fellow, and had not a second thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was glad to get home, nevertheless, where he need play the hypocrite no
      longer. Going through Sulby, he dropped out of the brake and looked in at
      the &ldquo;Fairy.&rdquo; The house was shut. Grannie was sitting up for Cæsar, and
      listening for the sound of wheels. There was something unusual and
      mysterious about her. Cruddled over the fire, she was smoking, a long clay
      in little puffs of blue smoke that could barely be seen. The sweet old
      soul in her troubles had taken to the pipe as a comforter. Pete could see
      that something had happened since morning, but she looked at him with damp
      eyes, and he was afraid to ask questions. He began to talk of the great
      doings of the day at Tynwald, then of Philip, and finally of Kate,
      apologising a little wildly for the mother not coming home sooner to the
      child, but protesting that she had sent the little one no end of presents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presents, bless ye,&rdquo; he began rapturously&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't ate enough, Pete, 'deed you don't,&rdquo; said Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ate? Did you say ate?&rdquo; cried Pete. &ldquo;If you'd seen me at the fair you'd
      have said, 'That man's got the inside of a limekiln!' Aw, no, Grannie, I'm
      not letting my jaws travel far. When I've got anything before me it's&mdash;down&mdash;same
      as an ostrich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Going away in the darkness, he heard Cæsar creaking up in the gig with old
      Horney, now old Mailie, diving along in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy was waiting for Pete at Elm Cottage. She tried to bustle him
      upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, man, come,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;get yourself off to bed and I'll bring your
      clothes down to the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had never slept in the bedroom since Kate had left. &ldquo;Chut! I've lost
      the habit of beds,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Always used of the gable loft, you know,
      and the wind above the thatch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not to be thought to behave otherwise than usual, he went upstairs that
      night. But&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Feather beds are saft,
          Pentit rooms are bonnie,
     But ae kiss o' my dear love
          Better's far than ony.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The rain was still falling, the sea was loud, the mighty breath of night
      was shaking the walls of the house and rioting through the town. He was
      wet and tired, longing for a dry skin and a warm bed and rest.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Yet fain wad I rise and rin
          If I tho't I would meet my dearie.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The long-strained rapture of faith and confidence was breaking down. He
      saw it breaking. He could deceive himself no more. She was gone, she was
      lost, she would lie on his breast no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God help me! O, Lord, help me,&rdquo; he cried in his crushed and breaking
      heart.

    <h2>
      XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Kate thought of her husband after she had left him, it was not with
      any crushing sense of shame. She had injured him, but she had gained
      nothing by it. On the contrary, she had suffered, she had undergone
      separation from her child. To soften the hard blow inflicted, she had
      outraged the tenderest feelings of her heart. As often as she thought of
      Pete and the deep wrong she had done him, she remembered this sacrifice,
      she wept over this separation. Thus she reconciled herself to her conduct
      towards her husband. If she had bought happiness at the cost of Pete's
      sufferings, her remorse might have been deep; but she had only accepted
      shame and humiliation and the severance of the dearest of her ties.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had said in the rapture of passionate confidence that if she
      possessed Philip's love there could be no humiliation and no shame, she
      had not yet dreamt of the creeping degradation of a life in the dark,
      under a false name, in a false connection: a life under the same roof with
      Philip, yet not by his side, unacknowledged, unrecognised, hidden and
      suppressed. Even at the moment of that avowal, somewhere in the secret
      part of her heart, where lay her love of refinement and her desire to be a
      lady, she had cherished the hope that Philip would find a way out of the
      meanness of their relation, that she would come to live openly beside him,
      she hardly knew how, and she did not care at what cost of scandal, for
      with Philip as her own she would be proud and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip had not found that way out, yet she did not blame him. She had
      begun to see that the deepest shame of their relation was not hers but
      his. Since she had lived in Philip's house the man in him had begun to
      decay. She could not shut her eyes to this rapid demoralisation, and she
      knew well that it was the consequence of her presence. The deceptions, the
      subterfuges, the mean shifts forced upon him day by day, by every chance,
      every accident, were plunging him in ever-deepening degradation. And as
      she realised this a new fear possessed her, more bitter than any
      humiliation, more crushing than any shame&mdash;the fear that he would
      cease to love her, the terror that he would come to hate her, as he
      recognised the depth to which she had dragged him down.

    <h2>
      XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Back from Tynwald, Philip was standing in his room. From time to time he
      walked to the window, which was half open, for the air was close and
      heavy. A misty rain was falling from an empty sky, and the daylight was
      beginning to fail. The tombstones below were wet, the treed were dripping,
      the churchyard was desolate. In a corner under the wall lay the angular
      wooden lid which is laid by a gravedigger over an open grave. Presently
      the iron gates swung apart, and a funeral company entered. It consisted of
      three persons and an uncovered deal coffin. One of the three was the
      sexton of the church, another was the curate, the third was a policeman.
      The sexton and the policeman carried the coffin to the church-door, which
      the curate opened. He then went into the church, and was followed by the
      other two. A moment later there were three strokes of the church bell.
      Some minutes after that the funeral company reappeared. It made for the
      open grave in the corner by the wall. The cover was removed, the coffin
      was lowered, the policeman half lifted his helmet, and the sexton put a
      careless hand to his cap. Then the curate opened a book and closed it
      again. The burial service was at an end. Half an hour longer the sexton
      worked alone in the drenching rain, shovelling the earth back into the
      grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some waif,&rdquo; thought Philip; &ldquo;some friendless, homeless, nameless waif.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went noiselessly up the stairs to the floor above, slinking through the
      house like a shadow. At a door above his own he knocked with a heavy hand,
      and a woman's voice answered him from within&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is any one there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is!,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am coming to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he opened the door and slipped into the room. It was a room like his
      own at all points, only lower in the ceiling, and containing a bed. A
      woman was standing with her back to the window, as if she had just turned
      about from looking into the churchyard. It was Kate. She had been
      expecting Philip, and waiting for him, but she seemed to be overwhelmed
      with confusion. As he crossed the floor to go to her, he staggered, and
      then she raised her eyes to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are ill,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Sit down. Shall I ring for the brandy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;We have had a hard day at Tyn-wald&mdash;some trouble&mdash;some
      excitement&mdash;I'm tired, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat on the end of the bed, and gazed out on the veil of rain, slanting
      across the square church tower and the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was at Ramsey two days ago,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that's what I came to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; She linked her hands before her, and gazed out also. Then, in a
      trembling voice, she asked, &ldquo;Is mother well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I did not see her, but&mdash;yes, she bears up bravely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; the words stuck in her throat, &ldquo;and Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, also&mdash;in health, at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that he is broken-hearted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a deep breath he answered, &ldquo;To listen to him you would think he was
      cheerful enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And little Katherine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is well too. I did not see her awake. It was late, and she was in her
      cradle. So rosy, and fresh, and beautiful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sweet darling! She was clean too? They take care of her, don't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More care they could not take.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling baby! Has she grown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; they talk of taking her out of the long clothes soon. Nancy is like
      a second mother to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate's foot was beating the floor. &ldquo;Oh, why can't her own mother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       she began, and then in a faltering voice, &ldquo;but that cannot be, I
      suppose.... Do her eyes change? Are they still blue? But she was asleep,
      you say. My dear baby! Was it very late? Nine o'clock? Just nine? I was
      thinking of her at that moment. It is true I am always thinking of her,
      but I remember, because the clock was striking. 'She will be in her little
      cot now,' I thought, 'bathed and clean, and so pretty in her nightdress,
      the one with the frill!' My sweet, sweet angel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her speech was confused and broken. &ldquo;Do you think if I never see her
      until... Will I know her if... It's useless to think of that, though. Is
      her hair like... What is the colour of her hair, Philip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair, quite fair; as fair as mine was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She swirled round, came face to face with him, and cried, &ldquo;Philip, Philip,
      why can't I have my darling to myself? She would be well enough here. I
      could keep her quiet. Oh, she would not disturb you. And I should be so
      happy with my little Kate for company. The time is long with me sometimes,
      Philip, and I could play with her all the day. And then at night, when she
      would be in the cot, I could make her little stock of clothes&mdash;her
      frocks and her little pinafores, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible, Kate, impossible!&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to the window. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, in a choking voice, &ldquo;I suppose
      it would even be stealing to fetch her away now. Only think! A mother
      stealing her own child! O gracious heaven, have I sinned myself so far
      from my innocent baby! My child, my child! My little Katherine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her bosom heaved, and she said in a hard tone, &ldquo;I daresay they think I'm a
      bad mother because I left her to others to nurse her and to love her, to
      see her every day and all day, to bathe her sweet body, and to comb her
      yellow hair, to look into her little blue eyes, and to watch all her
      pretty, pretty ways&mdash;Oh, yes, yes.&rdquo; she said, with increasing
      emotion, &ldquo;I daresay they think that of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They think nothing but what is good of you, Kate&mdash;nothing but what
      is good and kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked out on the rain which fell unceasingly, and said in a low
      voice, &ldquo;Is Pete still telling the same story&mdash;that I am only away for
      a little while&mdash;that I am coming back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is writing letters to himself now, and saying they come from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such simple things&mdash;all in his own way&mdash;full of love and
      happiness&mdash;<i>I am so happy and comfortable</i>&mdash;it is pitiful.
      He is like a child&mdash;he never suspects anything. You are better and
      enjoying yourself and looking forward to coming home soon. Sending kisses
      and presents for the baby, too, and greetings for everybody. There are
      messages for me also. <i>Your true and loving wife</i>&mdash;it is
      terrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She covered her face with both hands. &ldquo;And is he telling everybody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that's what the letters are meant for. He thinks he is keeping your
      name sweet and your place clean, so that you may return at any time, and
      scandal may not touch you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, why do you tell me that, Philip? It is dragging me back. And the
      child is dragging me back also... Does he show the letters to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse than that, Kate&mdash;much worse&mdash;he makes me answer them. I
      answered one the other night. Oh, when I think of it! <i>Dear wife, glad
      to get your welcome letters</i>. God knows how I held the pen&mdash;I was
      giddy enough to drop it. He gave you all the news&mdash;about your father,
      and Grannie, and everybody. All in his own bright way&mdash;poor old Pete,
      the cheeriest, sunniest soul alive. <i>The Dempster is putting a sight on
      us regular&mdash;trusts you are the better for leaving home</i>. It was
      awful&mdash;awful! <i>Dearest Kirry, I'm missing you mortal&mdash;worse
      than Kimberley. So come home soon, my true lil wife, to your foolish ould
      husband, for his heart is losing him.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leapt up, and began to tramp the floor. &ldquo;But why do I tell you this? I
      should bear my own burdens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hands had come down from her face, which was full of a great
      compassion. &ldquo;And did <i>you</i> have to write all that?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he meant no harm. He had no thought of hurting anybody! He never
      dreamt that every word was burning and blistering me to the heart of
      hearts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice deepened, and his face grew hard and ugly. &ldquo;But it was the same
      as if some devil out of hell had entered into the man and told him how to
      torture me&mdash;as if the cruellest tyrant on earth had made me take up
      the pen and write down my own death-warrant. I could have killed him&mdash;I
      could not help it&mdash;yes, I felt at that moment as if&mdash;&mdash; Oh,
      what am I saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, sat on the end of the bed again, and held his head between his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came and sat by his side. &ldquo;Philip,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am ruining you. Yes,
      I am corrupting you. I who would have had you so high and pure&mdash;and
      you so pure-minded&mdash;I am bringing you to ruin. Having me here is
      destroying you, Philip. No one visits you now. You are shutting the door
      on everybody.... I heard you come in last night, Philip. I hear you every
      night. Yes, I know everything. Oh, you will end by hating me&mdash;I know
      you will. Why don't you send me away? It will be better to send me away in
      time, Philip. Besides, it will make no difference. We are in the same
      house, yet we never meet. Send me away now, before it is too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dropped his hand and felt for her hand; he was trying not to look into
      her face. &ldquo;We have both suffered, Kate. We can never hate one another&mdash;we
      have suffered for each other's sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clung tightly to the hand he gave her, and said, &ldquo;Then you will never
      forsake me, whatever happens?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, Kate, never,&rdquo; he answered; and with a smothered cry she threw her
      arms about his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain continued to pour down on the roofs and on the tombs with a
      monotonous plash. &ldquo;But what is to be done?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to become of us, Philip? Are we never to smile on each other
      again? We cannot carry a burden like this for ever. To-day, to-morrow, the
      next day, the next year&mdash;is it to go on like this for a lifetime? Is
      this life? Is there nothing that will end it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Kate, yes; there is one thing that will end it&mdash;one thing
      only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;<i>death?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer. She rose slowly from his side and returned to the
      window, rested her forehead against the pane, and looked down on the
      desolate churchyard and the sexton at his work in the rain. Suddenly she
      broke the silence. &ldquo;Philip,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I know now what we ought to do. I
      wonder we have never thought of it before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing in front of him. Her breath came quickly. &ldquo;Tell Pete that
      I am dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took both his hands. &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept his face away from her. &ldquo;Kate, what are you saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is more natural, Philip? Only think&mdash;if you had been anybody
      else, it would have come to that already. You must have hated me for
      dragging you down into this mire of deceit, you must have forsaken me, and
      I must have gone to wreck and ruin. Oh, I see it all&mdash;just as if it
      had really happened. A solitary room somewhere&mdash;alone&mdash;sinking&mdash;dying&mdash;unknown,
      unnamed&mdash;forgotten&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were wandering about the room. &ldquo;It will kill him. If his heart
      can break, it will break it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has lived after a heavier blow than that, Philip. Do you think he is
      not suffering? For all his bright ways and hopeful talk and the letters
      and the presents, do you think he is not suffering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He liberated his hands, and began to tramp the room as before, but with
      head down dud hands linked behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be cruel to deceive him,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Philip, but kind. Death is not cruel. The wound it makes will heal.
      It won't bleed for ever. Once he thinks I am dead he will weep a little
      perhaps, and then &ldquo;&mdash;she was stifling a sob&mdash;&ldquo;then it will be
      all over. 'Poor girl,' he will say, 'she was much to blame. I loved her
      once, and never did her any wrong. But she is gone, and she was the mother
      of little Katherine&mdash;let us forget her faults'&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not heard her; he was standing before the window looking down. &ldquo;You
      are right, Kate, I think you must be right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will suffer, but he will get over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed. And you, Philip&mdash;he will torture you no longer. No more
      letters, no more presents, no more messages&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do it&mdash;I'll do it to-morrow,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened her arms wide, and cried, &ldquo;Kiss me, Philip, kiss me. We shall
      live again. Yes, we shall laugh together still&mdash;kiss me, kiss me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet&mdash;when I come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well&mdash;when you come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sank into a chair, crying with joy, and he went out as he had entered,
      noiselessly, stealthily, like a shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a man who is not a criminal is given over to a deep duplicity of
      life, he will clutch at any lie, wearing the mask of truth, which seems to
      shield him from shame and pain. He may be a wise man in every other
      relation, a shrewd man, a far-seeing and even a cunning man, but in this
      relation&mdash;that of his own honour, his own fame, his own safety&mdash;he
      is certain to be a blunderer, a bungler, and a fool. Such is the revenge
      of Nature, such is God's own vengeance!

    <h2>
      XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Philip was walking from Ballure House to Elm Cottage. It was late, and the
      night was dark and silent&mdash;a muggy, dank, and stagnant night, without
      wind or air, moon or stars. The road was quiet, the trees were still, the
      sea made only a far-off murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he walked he struggled to persuade himself that in what he was
      about to do he would be doing well. &ldquo;It will not be wrong to deceive him,&rdquo;
       he thought. &ldquo;It will only be for his own good. The suspense would kill
      him. He would waste away. The sap of the man's soul would dry up. Then why
      should I hesitate? Besides, it is partly true&mdash;true in its own sense,
      and that is the real sense. She <i>is</i> dead&mdash;dead to him. She can
      never return to him; she is lost to him for ever. So it is true after all&mdash;it
      is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a lie,&rdquo; said a voice at his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started. He could have been sure that somebody had spoken. Yet there
      was nobody by his side. He was alone in the road. &ldquo;It must have been my
      own voice,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I must have been thinking aloud.&rdquo; And then he
      resumed his walk and his meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if it is a lie, is it therefore a crime?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;Sure it
      is&mdash;how very sure!&mdash;it was a wise man that said so&mdash;a great
      fault once committed is the first link in a chain. The other links seem to
      be crimes also, but they are not&mdash;they are consequences. <i>Our</i>
      fault was long ago, and even then it was partly the fault of Fate. If the
      past could be recalled we could not act differently unless our fates were
      different. And what has followed has been only the consequence. It was the
      consequence when Kate was married to Pete; it was the consequence when she
      left him&mdash;and <i>this</i> is the consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a lie,&rdquo; said the same voice by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped. The darkness was gross around him&mdash;he could see nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer. He stretched his hand out nervously. There was no one
      at his side. &ldquo;It must have been the wind in the trees,&rdquo; he thought; but
      there could be no wind in the stagnant dampness of that air. &ldquo;It was like
      my own voice,&rdquo; he thought. Then he remembered how his man in Douglas had
      told him that he had contracted a habit of talking to himself of late. &ldquo;It
      was my own voice,&rdquo; he thought, and he went on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lie is a bad foundation to build on&mdash;that's certain. The thing
      that should be cannot rest on the thing that is not. It will topple down;
      it will come to ruin; it will wreck everything. Still&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a lie,&rdquo; said the voice again. There could be no mistaking it this
      time. It was a low, deep whisper. It seemed to be spoken in the very
      cavity of his ear. It was not his own voice, and yet it struck upon his
      sense with the sound as of his own. It must be his own voice speaking to
      himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      When this idea took hold of him, he was seized with a deadly shuddering.
      His heart knocked against his ribs, and an icy coldness came over him.
      &ldquo;Only the same tormenting dream,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Before it was a vision; now
      it is a voice. It is generated by solitude and separation. I must resist
      it I must be strong. It will drive me into an oppression as of madness.
      Men do not 'see their souls' until they are bordering on madness from
      religious mania or crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lie! a lie!&rdquo; said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is madness itself. To paint faces on the darkness, to hear voices in
      the air, is madness. The madman can do no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lie!&rdquo; said the voice again. He cast a look over his shoulder. It was
      the same as if some one had touched him and spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked faster. The voice seemed to walk with him. &ldquo;I will hold myself
      firm,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;I will not be afraid. Reason does not fail a man until
      he allows himself to <i>believe</i> that it is failing. 'I am going mad,'
      he thinks; and then he shrieks and is mad indeed. I will not depart from
      my course. If I do so now, I shall be lost. The horror will master me, and
      I shall be its slave for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had turned out of Ballure into the Ramsey Road, and he could see the
      town lights in the distance. But the voice continued to haunt him
      persistently, besiegingly, despotically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;what is the imaginary devil to the horror of
      this presence? Your own eye, your own voice, always with you, always
      following you! No darkness so dense that it can hide the sight, no noise
      so loud that it can deaden the sound!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked faster. Still the voice seemed to stride by his side, an
      invisible thing, with deliberate and noiseless step, from which there was
      no escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew up suddenly and walked slower. His knees were tottering, he was
      treading as on waves; yet he went on. &ldquo;I will not yield. I will master
      myself. I will do what I intended. I am not mad,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was at the gate of Elm Cottage by this time, and, with a strong glow of
      resolution, he walked boldly to the door and knocked.

    <h2>
      XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pete had not awakened until late that morning. While still in bed he had
      heard Grannie and Nancy in the room below. The first sound of their voices
      told him that something was amiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, God bless me, God bless me!&rdquo; said Nancy, as though with uplifted
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Kelly the postman,&rdquo; said Grannie in a doleful tone&mdash;the tone
      in which she had spoken between the puffs of her pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dirt!&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was up at Cæsar's before breakfast this morning,&rdquo; said Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now!&rdquo; cried Nancy. &ldquo;There's men like that, though. Just aiger for
      mischief. It's sweeter than all their prayers to them.... But where can
      she be, then? Has she made away with herself, poor thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I was asking Cæsar,&rdquo; said Grannie. &ldquo;If she's gone with the
      young Ballawhaine, what for aren't you going to England over and fetching
      her home?&rdquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did Cæsar say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No,' says he, 'not a step,' says he. 'If she's dead,' says he, 'we'll
      only know it a day the sooner, and if she's in life, it'll be a disgrace
      to us the longest day we live.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, bolla veen, bolla veen!&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;When some men is getting
      religion there's no more inside at them than a gutted herring, and they're
      good for nothing but to put up in the chimley to smook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Black Tom, woman,&rdquo; said Grannie. &ldquo;Cæsar's freckened mortal of the
      man's tongue going. 'It's water to his wheel,' he's saying. 'He'll be
      telling me to set my own house in order, and me a local preacher, too.'
      But how's the man himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete?&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;Aw, tired enough last night, and not down yet....
      Hush!... It's his foot on the loft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy! poor boy!&rdquo; said Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child cried, and then somebody began to beat the floor to the measure
      of a long-drawn hymn. Grannie must have been sitting before the fire with
      the baby across her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something has happened,&rdquo; thought Pete as he drew on his clothes. A moment
      later something had happened indeed. He had opened a drawer of the
      dressing-table and found the wedding-ring and the earrings where Kate had
      left them. There was a commotion in the room below by this time, but Pete
      did not hear it. He was crying in his heart. &ldquo;It is coming! I know it! I
      feel it! God help me! Lord forgive me! Amen! Amen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar, the postman, and the constable, as a deputation from &ldquo;The
      Christians,&rdquo; had just entered the house. Black Tom was with them. He was
      the ferret that had fetched them out of their holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get thee home, woman,&rdquo; said Cæsar to Grannie, &ldquo;This is no place for thee.
      It is the abode of sin and deception.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the home of my child's child, and that's enough for me,&rdquo; said
      Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get thee back, I tell thee,&rdquo; said Cæsar, &ldquo;and come thee to this house of
      shame no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take her, Nancy,&rdquo; said Grannie, giving up the child. &ldquo;Shame enough,
      indeed, I'm thinking, when a woman has to shut her heart to her own flesh
      and blood if she's not to disrespect her husband,&rdquo; and she went off,
      weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cæsar's emotions were walled in by his pietistical views. &ldquo;Every one
      that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother,
      or wife, or children, or land, for My name's sake, shall receive an
      hundredfold,&rdquo; said Cæsar, with a cast of his eye towards Black Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I ever!&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;The husband that wanted the like of that
      from me now.... A hundredfold, indeed! No, not for a hundred hundredfolds,
      the nasty dirt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't he turning up your nose, woman, but call your master,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's more than some ones need do, then, and I won't call my master,
      neither&mdash;no, thank you,&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've something to tell him, and I've come, too, for to do it,&rdquo; said
      Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil came farther than ever you did, and it was only a lie he was
      bringing for all that,&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hould your tongue, Nancy Cain,&rdquo; said Cæsar, &ldquo;and take that Popish thing
      off the child's head.&rdquo; It was the scarlet hood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pity the money that's wasted on the like wasn't given to the poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard something the same before, Cæsar Cregeen,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;It was
      Judas Iscariot was saying it first, and you're just thieving it from a
      thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chut!&rdquo; cried Cæsar, goaded by the laughter of Black Tom. &ldquo;I'll call the
      man myself. Peter Quilliam!&rdquo; and he made for the staircase door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand back,&rdquo; cried Nancy, holding the child like a pillow over one of her
      arms, and lifting the other threateningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, you'll never be raising your hand to the man of God, woman,&rdquo; giggled
      Black Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't I, though?&rdquo; said Nancy grimly, &ldquo;or the man of the devil either,&rdquo;
       she added, flashing at himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman's not to trust, sir,&rdquo; snuffled the constable. &ldquo;She's only an
      infidel, anyway. I've heard tell of her saying she didn't believe the
      whale swallowed Jonah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the diff'rance between us, then,&rdquo; said Nancy; &ldquo;for there's some of
      you Manx ones would believe if Jonah swallowed the whale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The staircase door opened at the back of Nancy, and Pete stepped into the
      room. &ldquo;What's this, friends?&rdquo; he asked, in a careworn voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar stepped forward with a yellow envelope in his hand. &ldquo;What's <i>that</i>,
      sir?&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete took the envelope and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's your letter back to you through the dead letter office, isn't it?&rdquo;
       said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nobody of that name in that place, is there!&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Pete again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letters from England don't come through Peel, but your first letter had
      the Peel postmark, hadn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parcels from England don't come through Port St. Mary, but your parcel
      was stamped in Port St. Mary, wasn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The handwriting inside the letter wasn't your own handwriting, was it?
      The address on the outside of the parcel wasn't your own address&mdash;no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough to be going on, I'm thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Uncle Joe?&rdquo; said Black Tom, with another giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mistress is not in Liverpool. You don't know where she is. She has
      gone the way of all sinners,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that what you're coming to tell me?&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; we're coming to tell you,&rdquo; said Cæsar, &ldquo;that, as a notorious loose
      liver, we must be putting her out of class. And we're coming to call on
      yourself to look to your own salvation. You've deceaved us, Mr. Quilliam.
      You've grieved the Spirit of the Lord,&rdquo; with another &ldquo;glime&rdquo; in the
      direction of Black Tom; &ldquo;you've brought contempt on the fellowship that
      counts you for one of the fold. You've given the light of your countenance
      to the path of an evildoer, and you've brought down the head of a child of
      God with sorrow to the grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar was moved by his self-satisfied piety, and began to make' noises in
      his nostrils. &ldquo;Let us lay the case before the Lord,&rdquo; he said; and he went
      down on his knees and prayed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our brother has deceived us, O Lord, but we forgive him freely. Forgive
      Thou also his trespasses, so that at the last he escape hell-fire. Count
      not Thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial, wherever she is this day. May
      it be good for her to be cut off from the body of the righteous. Grant
      that she feel this mercy in her carnal body before her eternal soul be
      called to everlasting judgment. Lord, strengthen Thy servant. Let not his
      natural affections be as the snare of the fowler unto his feet. Though it
      grieve him sore, even to tears and tribulation, help him to pluck out the
      gourd that groweth in his own bosom&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear heart alive!&rdquo; cried Nancy, clattering her clogs, &ldquo;it's a wonder in
      the world the man isn't thinking shame to blacken his own daughter before
      the Almighty Himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be merciful, O Lord,&rdquo; continued Cæsar, &ldquo;to all rank unbelievers, and such
      as live in heathen darkness in a Christian land, and don't know Saturday
      from Sunday, and are imper-ent uncommon and bad with the tongue&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop that now.&rdquo; cried Nancy, &ldquo;that's meant for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete had stood through this in silence, but with an angry, miserable face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm not going for denying to what you say. I'm
      like the fish at the heel of the trawl-boat&mdash;the net's closing in on
      me and I'm caught. The game's up. I did deceave you. I <i>did</i> write
      those letters myself. I've no Uncle Joe, nor no Auntie Joney neither. My
      wife's left me. I'm not knowing where she is, or what's becoming of her.
      I'm done, and I'm for throwing up the sponge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were grunts of satisfaction. &ldquo;But don't you feel the need of pardon,
      brother,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;What I was doing I was doing for the best, and, if
      I was doing wrong, the Almighty will have to forgive me&mdash;that's about
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar shot out his lip. Pete raised himself to his full height and looked
      from face to face, until his eyes settled on the postman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it takes a thief to catch a thief,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Which of you was the
      thief that catcht me? Maybe I've been only a blundering blockhead, and
      perhaps you've been clever, and smart uncommon, but I'm thinking there's
      some of you hasn't been rocked enough for all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out the yellow envelope. &ldquo;This letter was sealed when you gave it
      to me, Mr. Cregeen&mdash;how did you know what was inside of it? 'On Her
      Majesty's Sarvice,' you say. But it isn't dead letters only that's coming
      with words same as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The postman was meddling with his front hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord has His own wayses of doing His work, has He, Cæsar? I never
      heard tell, though, that opening other people's letters was one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kelly's ferret eyes were nearly twinkling themselves out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete threw letter and envelope into the fire. &ldquo;You've come to tell me
      you're going to turn my wife out of class. All right! You can turn me out,
      too, and if the money I gave you is anywhere handy, you can turn that out
      at the same time and make a clane job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Black Tom was doubling with suppressed laughter at the corner of the
      dresser, and Cæsar was writhing under his searching glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're knowing a dale about the ould Book and I'm not knowing much,&rdquo; said
      Pete, &ldquo;but isn't it saying somewhere, 'Let him that's without sin amongst
      you chuck the first stone?' I'm not worth mentioning for a saint myself,
      so I lave it with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice began to break. &ldquo;You're thinking a dale about the broken law
      seemingly, but I'm thinking more about the broken heart. There's the like
      in somewhere, you go bail. The woman that's gone may have done wrong&mdash;I'm
      not saying she didn't, poor thing; but if she comes home again, you may
      turn her out, but I'll take her back, whatever she is and whatever she's
      done&mdash;so help me God I will&mdash;and I'll not wait for the Day of
      Judgment to ask the Almighty if I'm doing right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he sat down with his back to them on a chair before the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you can go home to nurse,&rdquo; said Nancy, wiping her eyes, &ldquo;and lave me
      to sweeten the kitchen&mdash;it's wanting water enough after dirts like
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar also was wiping his eye&mdash;the one nearest to Black Tom. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo;
       he said with plaintive resignation, &ldquo;our errand was useless. The Ethiopian
      cannot change his skin, nor the leopard his spots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but he can get a topcoat to cover them, though,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;Oh,
      that flea sticks, does it, Cæsar? Don't blame the looking-glass if your
      face is ugly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar pretended not to hear her. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, with a sigh discharged
      at Pete's back, &ldquo;we'll pray, spite of appearances, that we may all go to
      heaven together some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, not me,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;I wouldn't be-mane myself going
      anywhere with the like of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Job in Cæsar could bear up no longer. &ldquo;Vain and ungrateful woman,&rdquo; he
      cried, &ldquo;who hath eaten of my bread and drunken of my cup&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cursing me, are you?&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;Sakes! you must have been found in the
      bulrushes at Pharaoh's daughter and made a prophet of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use bandying words, sir, wid a single woman dat lives alone wid a
      single man,&rdquo; said Mr. Niplightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy flopped the child from her right arm to her left, and with the back
      of her hand she slapped the constable across the face. &ldquo;Take that for the
      cure of a bad heart,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and tell the Dempster I gave it you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she turned on the postman and Black Tom. &ldquo;Out of it, you lil thief,
      your mouth's only a dirty town-well and your tongue's the pump in it. Go
      home and die, you big black spider&mdash;you're ould enough for it and
      wicked enough, too. Out of it, the lot of you!&rdquo; she cried, and clashed the
      door at their backs, and then opened it again for a parting shot. &ldquo;And if
      it's true you're on your way to heaven together, just let me know, and
      I'll see if I can't put up with the other place myself.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      That evening Pete was sitting with one foot on the cradle rocker, one arm
      on the table, and the other hand trifling tenderly with the ring and the
      earrings which he had found in the drawer of the dressing-table, when
      there was a hurried knock on the door. It had the hollow reverberation of
      a knock on the lid of a coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; called Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Philip, but it was almost as if Death had entered, so thin and bony
      were his cheeks, so wild his eyes, so cold his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete was prepared for anything. &ldquo;You've found me out, too, I see you
      have,&rdquo; he said defiantly. &ldquo;You needn't tell <i>me</i>&mdash;it's chasing
      caught fish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be brave, Pete,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;It will be a great shock to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete looked up and his manner changed. &ldquo;Speak it out, sir. It's a poor man
      that can't stand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've come on the saddest errand,&rdquo; said Philip, taking a seat as far away
      as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've found her&mdash;you've seen her, sir. Where is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Philip, and then he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, mate; I've known trouble before to-day,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you bear it?&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;She is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and he stopped
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is&mdash;where?&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is dead,&rdquo; said Philip at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete rose to his feet. Philip rose also, and now poured out his message
      with the headlong rush of a cataract.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, it all happened some time ago, Pete, but I couldn't bring myself
      to tell you before. I tried, but I couldn't. It was in Douglas&mdash;of a
      fever&mdash;in a lodging&mdash;alone&mdash;unattended&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hould hard, sir! Give me time,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;I'd a gunshot wound at
      Kimberley, and since then I've a stitch in my side at whiles and sometimes
      a bit of a catch in my breathing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He staggered to the porch door and threw it open, then came back panting&mdash;&ldquo;Dead!
      dead! Kate is dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy came from the kitchen at the moment, and hearing what he was saying,
      she lifted both hands and uttered a piercing shriek. He took her by the
      shoulders and turned her back, shut the door behind her, and said, holding
      his right hand hard at his side, &ldquo;Women are brave, sir, but when the storm
      breaks on a man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off and muttered again, &ldquo;Dead!
      Kirry is dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child, awakened by Nancy's cry, was now whimpering fretfully. Pete
      went to the cradle and rocked it with one foot, crooning in a quavering
      treble, &ldquo;Hush-a-bye! hush-a-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip's breathing was oppressed. He felt like a man at the edge of a
      precipice, with an impulse to throw himself over. &ldquo;God forgive me,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I could kill myself. I've broken your heart;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fear of me, sir,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;I'm an ould hulk that's seen weather.
      I'll not go to pieces from inside at all. Give me time, mate, give me
      time.&rdquo; And then he went on muttering as before, &ldquo;Dead! Kirry dead!
      Hush-a-bye! My Kirry dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little one slept, and Pete drew back in his chair, nodded into the
      fire, and said in a weak, childish voice, &ldquo;I've known her all my life,
      d'ye know? She's been my lil sweetheart since she was a slip of a girl,
      and slapped the schoolmaster for bating me wrongously. Swate lil thing in
      them days, mate, with her brown feet and tossing hair. And now she's a
      woman and she's dead! The Lord have mercy upon me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up and began to walk heavily across the floor, dipping and plunging
      as if going upstairs. &ldquo;The bright and happy she was when I started for
      Kimberley, too; with her pretty face by the aising stones in the morning,
      all laughter and mischief. Five years I was seeing it in my drames like
      that, and now it's gone. Kirry is gone! My Kirry! God help me! O God, have
      mercy upon me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped in his unsteady walk, and sat and stared into the fire. His
      eyes were red; blotches of heart's blood seemed to be rising to them; but
      there was not the sign of a tear. Philip did not attempt to console him.
      He felt as if the first syllable would choke in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see how it's been, sir,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;While I was away her heart was
      changing her, and when I came back she thought she must keep her word. My
      poor lamb! She was only a child anyway. But I was a man&mdash;I ought to
      have seen how it was. I'm like a drowning man, too&mdash;things are coming
      back on me. I'm seeing them plain enough now. But it's too late! My poor
      Kirry! And I thought I was making her so happy!&rdquo; Then, with a helpless
      look, &ldquo;You wouldn't believe it, sir, but I was never once thinking nothing
      else. No, I wasn't; it's a fact. I was same as a sailor working all the
      voyage home, making a cage, and painting it goold, for the love-bird he's
      catcht in the sunny lands somewhere; but when he's putting it in, it's
      only wanting away, poor thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a sense of grovelling meanness, Philip sat and listened. Then, with
      eyes wandering across the floor, he said, &ldquo;You have nothing to reproach
      yourself with. You did everything a man could do&mdash;everything. And she
      was innocent also. It was the fault of another. He came between you.
      Perhaps he thought he couldn't help it&mdash;perhaps he persuaded himself&mdash;God
      knows what lie he told himself&mdash;but she's innocent, Pete; believe me,
      she's&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete brought his fist down heavily on the table, and the rings that lay on
      it jumped and tingled. &ldquo;What's that to me?&rdquo; he cried hoarsely. &ldquo;What do I
      care if she's innocent or guilty? She's dead, isn't she? and that's
      enough. Curse the man! I don't want to hear of him. She's mine now. What
      for should he come here between me and my own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The torn heart and racked brain could bear no more. Pete dropped his head
      on the table. Presently his anger ebbed. Without lifting his head, he
      stretched his hand across the rings to feel for Philip's hand. Philip's
      hand trembled in his grasp. He took that for sympathy, and became the more
      ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me time, mate,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'll be my own man soon. My head's
      moithered dreadful&mdash;I'm not knowing if I heard you right. In Douglas,
      you say? By herself, too? Not by herself, surely? Not quite alone neither?
      She found you out, didn't she? <i>You'd</i> be there, Phil? You'd be with
      her yourself? She'd be wanting for nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip answered huskily, his eyes still wandering. &ldquo;If it will be any
      comfort to you... yes, I <i>was</i> with her&mdash;she wanted for
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor girl!&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Did she send&mdash;had she any&mdash;maybe she
      said a word or two&mdash;at the last, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip clutched at the question. There was something at last that he could
      say without falsehood. &ldquo;She sent a prayer for your forgiveness,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;She told me to tell you to think of her as little as might be; not to
      grieve for her too much, and to try to forget her, so that her sin also
      might be forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the lil one&mdash;anything about the lil one?&rdquo; asked Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the bitterest grief of all,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;It was so hard that
      you must think her an unnatural mother. 'My Katherine! My little
      Katherine! My sweet angel!' It was her cry the whole day long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, I see,&rdquo; said Pete, nodding at the fire; &ldquo;she left the lil one for
      my sake, wanting it with her all the while. Poor thing! You'd comfort her,
      Philip? You'd let her go aisy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The child is well and happy,' I told her. 'He's thinking nothing of
      yourself but what is good and kind,' I said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God's peace rest on her! My darling! My wife!&rdquo; said Pete solemnly. Then
      suddenly in another tone, &ldquo;Do you know where she's buried?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip hesitated. He had not foreseen this question. Where had been his
      head that he had never thought of it? But there was no going back now. He
      was compelled to go on. He must tell lie on lie. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you take me to the grave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip gasped; the sweat broke out on his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be freckened, sir,&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;I'm my own man again. Could you
      take me to my wife's grave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Philip. He was in the rapids. He was on the edge of
      precipitation. He was compelled to go over. He made a blindfold plunge.
      Lie on lie; lie on lie!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we'll start by the coach to-morrow,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip rose with rigid limbs. He had meant to tell one lie only, and
      already he had told many. Truly &ldquo;a lie is a cripple;&rdquo; it cannot stand
      alone. &ldquo;Good night, Pete; I'll go home. I'm not well to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll stop the coach at your aunt's gate in the morning,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stepped to the door together, and stood for a moment in the dank and
      lifeless darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world's getting wonderful lonely, man, and you're all that's left to
      me now, Phil&mdash;you and the child. I'm not for wailing, though. When I
      got my gun-shot wound out yonder, I was away over the big veldt, hundreds
      of miles from anywhere, behind the last bush and the last blade of grass,
      with the stones and the ashes and the dust&mdash;about as far, you'd say,
      as the world was finished, and never looking to see herself and the ould
      island and the ould faces no more. I'm not so lonesome as that at all.
      Good-night, ould fellow, and God bless you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gate opened and closed, Philip went stumbling up the road. He was
      hating Pete. To hate this open-hearted man who had dragged him into an
      entanglement of lies was the only resource of his stifled conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete went back to the house, muttering, &ldquo;Kirry is dead! Kirry is dead!&rdquo; He
      put the catch on the door, said, &ldquo;Close the shutters, Nancy,&rdquo; and then
      returned to his chair by the cradle.

      XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Later the same night Pete carried the news to Sulby. Grannie was in the
      bar-room, and he broke it to her gently, tenderly, lovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loud voices came from the kitchen. Cæsar was there in angry contention
      with Black Tom. An open Bible was between them on their knees. Tom tugged
      it towards him, bobbed his blunt forefinger down on the page, and cried,
      &ldquo;There's the text&mdash;that'll pin you&mdash;<i>publicans and sinners</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar leaned back'in his seat, and said with withering scorn, &ldquo;It's a bad
      business&mdash;I'll give you lave to say that. It's men like you that's
      making it bad. But whether is it better for a bad business to be in bad
      hands or in good ones? There's a big local praicher in London, they're
      telling me, that's hot for joining the public-house to the church, and
      turning the parsons into the publicans. That's what they all were on the
      Isle of Man in ould days gone by, and pity they're not so still. Oh, I've
      been giving it my sarious thoughts, sir. I've been making it a subject for
      prayer. 'Will I give up my public or hould fast to it to keep it out of
      worse hands?' And I'm strong to believe the Lord hath spoken. 'It's a
      little vineyard&mdash;a little work in a little vineyard. Stick to it,
      Cæsar,' and so I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete stepped into the kitchen and flung his news at Cæsar with a sort of
      wild melancholy, as who would say, &ldquo;There, is that enough for you? Are you
      satisfied now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mair yee shoh</i>&mdash;it's the hand of God,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A middling bad hand then,&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;I've seen better, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A high spiritual pride took hold of Cæsar&mdash;Black Tom was watching
      him, and working his big eyebrows vigorously. With mouth firmly shut and
      head thrown back, Cæsar said in a sepulchral voice, &ldquo;The Lord gave, and
      the Lord hath taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete made a crack of savage laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you feeling it, sir?&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a feel near me,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;I never did the Lord no harm that I know
      of, but He's taken my young wife and left my poor innocent lil one
      motherless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unsearchable the wisdom and justice of God,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unsearchable?&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;It's all that. But I don't know if you're
      calling it justice. I'm not myself. It isn't my tally. Blasphemy? I lave
      it with you. A scoffer, am I? So be it. The Lord's licked me, and I've had
      enough. But I'm not going down on my knees for it, anyway. The Almighty
      and me is about quits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that word on his lips he strode out of the place, grim, implacable,
      almost savage, a fierce smile fluttering on his ashy face.

    <h2>
      XXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Grannie came to Elm Cottage next morning with two duck eggs for Pete's
      breakfast. She was boiling them in a saucepan when Pete came downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come now,&rdquo; she said coaxingly, as she laid them on the table, with the
      water smoking off the shells. But Pete could not eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn't destroyed any food these days,&rdquo; said Nancy. A little before she
      had rolled her apron, slipped out into the street, and brought back a tiny
      packet screwed up in a bit of newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he'll ate them on the road,&rdquo; said Grannie. &ldquo;I'll put them in the
      hankerchief in his hat anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My faith, no, woman!&rdquo; cried Nancy. &ldquo;He's the mischief for sweating. He'll
      be mopping his forehead and forgetting the eggs. But here&mdash;where's
      your waistcoat pocket, Pete? Have you room for a hayseed anywhere?
      There!... It's a quarter of twist, poor boy,&rdquo; she whispered behind her
      hand to Grannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they vied with each other in little attentions to the down-hearted
      man. Meantime Crow, the driver of the Douglas coach, a merry old sinner
      with a bulbous nose and short hair, standing erect like the steel pins of
      an electric brush, was whistling as he put his horses to in the
      marketplace. Presently he swirled round the corner and drew up at the
      gate. The women then became suddenly quiet, and put their aprons to their
      mouths, as if a hearse had stopped at the door; but Pete bustled about and
      shouted boisterously to cover the emotion of his farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Grannie; I'll say a word for you when I get there. Good-bye,
      Nancy; I'll not be forgetting yourself neither. Good bye, lil bogh,&rdquo;
       dropping on one knee at the side of the cradle. &ldquo;What right has a man's
      heart to be going losing him while he has a lil innocent like this to live
      for? Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a throng of women at the gate talking of Kate. &ldquo;Aw, a civil
      person, very&mdash;a civiller person never was.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It's me that'll be
      missing her too. I served her eggs to the day of her death, as you might
      say. 'Good morning, Christian Anne,' says she&mdash;just like that.
      Welcome, you say? I was at home at the woman's door.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;And the
      beautiful she came home in the gig with the baby! Only yesterday you might
      say. And now, Lord-a-massy!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hush! it's himself! I'm fit enough to
      cry when I look at the man. The cheerful heart is broke at him.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They dropped their heads so that Pete might avoid their gaze, and held the
      coach-door open for him, expecting that he would go inside, as to a
      funeral. But he saluted them with &ldquo;Good morning all,&rdquo; and leapt to the
      box-seat with Crow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coach stopped to take up the Deemster at the gate of Ballure House.
      Philip looked thin and emaciated, and walked with a death-like weakness,
      but also a feverish resolution. Behind him, carrying a rag, came Aunty Nan
      in her white cap, with little nervous attentions, and a face full of
      anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive inside to-day, Philip,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he answered, and kissed her, pushed her to the other side of the
      gate with gentle protestation, and climbed to Pete's side. Then the old
      lady said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Peter. I'm so sorry for your great trouble, and trust...
      But you'll not let the Deemster ride too long outside if it grows... He's
      had a sleepless night and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Crow,&rdquo; said Philip, in a decisive voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see to that, Miss Christian, ma'am,&rdquo; shouted Crow over his shoulder.
      &ldquo;His honour's studdying a bit too hard&mdash;that's what <i>he</i> is. But
      a gentleman's not much use if his wife's a widow, as the man said&mdash;eh?
      Looking well enough yourself, though, Miss Christian, ma'am. Getting
      younger every day, in fact. I'll have to be fetching that East Indee
      capt'n up yet. I will that. Ha! ha! Get on, Boxer!&rdquo; Then, with a flick of
      the whip, they were off on their journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was calm and beautiful. Old Barrule wore his yellow skull-cap of
      flowering gorse, the birds sang on the trees, and the sea on the shore
      sang also with the sound of far-off joy-bells. It was a heart-breaking day
      to Pete, but he tried to bear himself bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was seated between Philip and the driver. On the farther side of Crow
      there were two other passengers, a farmer and a fisherman. The farmer, a
      foul-mouthed fellow with a long staff and two dogs racing and barking on
      the road, was returning from Midsummer fair, at which he had sold his
      sheep; the fisherman, a simple creature, was coming home from the
      mackerel-fishing at Kinsale, with a box of the fish between his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wife's been having a lil one since I was laving in March,&rdquo; said the
      fisherman, laughing all over his bronzed face. &ldquo;A boy, d'ye say? Aw,
      another boy, of coorse. Three of them now&mdash;all men. Got a letter at
      Ramsey post-office coming through. She's getting on as nice as nice, and
      the ould woman's busy doing for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee up, Boxer&mdash;we'll wet its head at the Hibernian,&rdquo; said Crow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not partic'lar at all,&rdquo; said the fisherman cheerily. &ldquo;The mack'rel's
      been doing middling this season, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then in his simple way he went on to paint home, and the joy of coming
      back to it, with the new baby, and the mother in child-bed, and the
      grandmother as housekeeper, and the other children waiting for new frocks
      and new jackets out of the earnings of the fishing, and himself going
      round to pay the grocer what had been put on &ldquo;strap&rdquo; while he was at
      Kin-sale, till Pete was melted, and could listen no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm persuaded still she wasn't well when she went away,&rdquo; he whispered,
      turning his shoulder to the men and his face to Philip. He talked in a low
      voice, just above the rumble of the wheels, trying to extenuate Kate's
      fault and to excuse her to Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no use thinking hard of anybody, is it, sir?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We can't
      crawl into another person's soul, as the saying is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that he asked many questions&mdash;about Kate's illness, about the
      doctor, about the funeral, about everything except the man&mdash;of him he
      asked nothing. Philip was compelled to answer. He was like a prisoner
      chained at the galleys&mdash;he was forced to go on. They crossed the
      bridge over the top of Ballaglass, which goes down to the mill at Cornaa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the glen, sir,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Aw, the dear ould days! Wading in the
      water, leaping over the stones, clambering on the trunks&mdash;aw, dear!
      aw, dear! Bareheaded and barefooted in those times, sir; but smart
      extraordinary, and a terble notion of being dressy, too. Twisting ferns
      about her lil neck for lace, sticking a mountain thistle, sparkling with
      dew, on her breast for a diamond, twining a trail of fuchsia round her
      head for a crown&mdash;aw, dear! aw, dear! And now&mdash;well, well, to
      think! to think!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was laughter on the other side of the coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do <i>you</i> say, Capt'n Pete?&rdquo; shouted Crow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; asked Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fisherman had treated the driver and the farmer at the Hibernian, and
      was being rewarded with robustious chaff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm telling Dan Johnny here these childers that's coming when a man's
      away from home isn't much to trust. Best put a sight up with the lil one
      to the wise woman of Glen Aldyn, eh? A man doesn't like to bring up a
      cuckoo in the nest&mdash;what d'ye say, Capt'n?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say you're a dirty ould divil, Crow; and I don't want to be chucking
      you off your seat,&rdquo; said Pete; and with that he turned back to Philip. *
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver was affronted, but the farmer pacified him by an appeal to his
      fear. &ldquo;He'd be coarse to tackle, the same fellow&mdash;I saw him clane out
      a tent with one hand at Tyn-wald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a wonder she didn't come home for all,&rdquo; said Pete at Philip's ear&mdash;&ldquo;at
      the end, you know. Couldn't face it out, I suppose? Nothing to be afraid
      of, though, if she'd only known. I had kept things middling straight up to
      then. And I'd have broke the head of the first man that'd wagged a tongue.
      But maybe it was myself she was freckened of! Freckened of me! Poor thing!
      poor thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was in torment. To witness Pete's simple grief, to hear him breathe
      a forgiveness for the erring woman, and to be trusted with the thoughts of
      his heart as a father might be trusted by a young child&mdash;it was
      anguish, it was agony, it was horror. More than once he felt an impulse to
      cast off his load, to confess, to tell everything. But he reflected that
      he had no right to do this&mdash;that the secret was not his own to give
      away. His fear restrained him also. He looked into Pete's face, so full of
      manly sorrow, and shuddered to think of it transformed by rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit hard, gentlemen. Breeches' work here,&rdquo; shouted Crow.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were at the top of the steep descent going down to Laxey. The white
      town lay sprinkled over the green banks of the glen, and the great
      water-wheel stood in the depths of the mountain gill behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's there! She's yonder! It's herself at the door. She's up. She's
      looking out for the coach,&rdquo; cried the fisherman, clambering up on to the
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aisy all,&rdquo; shouted Crow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use, Mr. Crow. Nothing will persuade me but that's herself with the
      lil one in a blanket at the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the coach had drawn up at the bridge, the fisherman had leapt to
      the ground, shouldered his keg, shouted &ldquo;Good everin' all,&rdquo; and
      disappeared down an alley of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver alighted. A crowd gathered around. There were parcels to take
      up, parcels to set down, and the horses to water. When the coach was ready
      to start again, the farmer with his dogs had gone, but there was a
      passenger for an inside place. It was a girl, a bright young thing, with a
      comely face and laughing black eyes. She was dressed smartly, after her
      country fashion, in a hat covered with scarlet poppies, and with a vast
      brooch at the neck of her bodice. In one hand she carried a huge bunch of
      sweet-smelling gilvers. A group of girl companions came to see her off,
      and there was much giggling and chatter and general excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you forgetting the pouch and pipe, Emma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see; am I? No; it's here in my frock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you'll be coming together by the coach at nine, it's like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's like we will, Liza, if the steamer isn't late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, ladies, off the step! Any room for a lil calf' in the straw
      with you, missy? Freckened? Tut! Only a lil calf, as clane as clane&mdash;and
      breath as swate as your own, miss. There you are&mdash;it'll be lying
      quiet enough till we get to Douglas. All ready? Ready we are then. Collar
      work now, gentlemen. Aise the horse, sir. Thank you! Thank you! Not you,
      your Honour&mdash;sit where you are, Dempster.&rdquo;

      XXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pete got down to walk up the hill, but Philip, though he made some show of
      alighting also, was glad of the excuse to remain in his seat. It relieved
      him of Pete's company for a while, at all events. He had time to ask
      himself again why he was there, where he was going to, and what he was
      going to do. But his brain was a cloudy waste. Only one picture emerged
      from the maze. It was that of the burial of the nameless waif in the grave
      at the foot of the wall. If he was conscious of any purpose, it was a
      vague idea of going to that grave. But it lay ahead of him only as an
      ultimate goal. He was waiting and watching for an opportunity of escape.
      If it came, God be praised! If it did not come, God help and forgive him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Pete walked behind, and caught fragments of a conversation
      between the girl and Crow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you're going to meet himself coming home, miss, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My faith, how d'ye know that? But it's yourself for knowing things, Mr.
      Crow. Has he been sailing foreign? Yes, sir; and nine months away for a
      week come Monday. But spoken at Holyhead in Tuesday's paper, and paid off
      in Liverpool yesterday. That's his 'nitials, if you want to know&mdash;J.
      W. I worked them on the pouch myself. I've spun him a web for a jacket,
      too. Sweethearting with the miner fellows while Jemmy's been away? Have I,
      d'ye say? How people <i>will</i> be talking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, no offence at all. But sorry you're not keeping another string to
      your bow, missy. These sailor lads aren't partic'lar, anyway. Bless your
      heart, no; but getting as tired of one swateheart as a pig of brewer's
      grain. Constant? Chut! When the like of that sort is away foreign, he lays
      up of the first girl he comes foul of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl laughed, and shook her head bravely, but the tears were beginning
      to trickle from her eyes, and the hand that held the flowers was
      trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't listen to the man, my dear,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;There's too much comic in
      these ould bachelor bucks. Your boy is dying to get home to you. Go bail
      on that, Emma. The packet isn't making half way enough for him, and he's
      bad dreadful wanting to ship aloft and let out the topsail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the crest of the hill Pete climbed back to Philip's side, and said,
      &ldquo;The heart's a quare thing, sir. Got its winds and tides same as anything
      else. The wind blows contrary ways in one day, and it's the same with the
      heart itself. Changeable? Well, maybe! We shouldn't be too hard on it for
      all.... If I'd only known now.... She wasn't much better than a child when
      I left for Kimberley... and then what was I? I was only common stuff
      anyway... not much fit for the likes of herself, when you think of it,
      sir.... If I'd only guessed when I came back.... I could have done it, sir&mdash;I
      was loving the woman like life, but if I'd only known, now.... Well, and
      what's love if it's thinking of nothing but itself? If I'd thought she was
      loving another man by the time I came home, I could have given her up to
      him&mdash;yes, I could; I'm persuaded I could&mdash;-so help me God, I
      could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was wasting on that journey like a piece of wax. Pete saw his face
      melting away till it looked more like a skeleton than the face of à man
      really alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't be taking it so bad at all, Phil,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;She'll be
      middling right where she's gone to, sir. She'll be right enough yonder,&rdquo;
       he said, rolling his head sideways to where the sun was going round to its
      setting. And then softly, as if half afraid she might not be, he muttered
      into his beard, &ldquo;God be good to my poor broken-hearted girl, and forgive
      her sins for Christ's sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An elderly gentleman got on the coach at Onchan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helloa, Deemster!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You look as sober as an old crow. Sober!
      Old Crow! Ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was a facetious person of high descent in the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crow never goes home without getting off the box once or twice to pick up
      the moonlight on the road&mdash;do you, Crow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll do, parson, that'll do!&rdquo; roared Crow. And then his reverence
      leaned across the driver and directed the shaft of his wit at Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how's the young housekeeper, Deemster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip shuddered visibly, and made some inarticulate reply&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-looking young woman, they're telling me. Jem-y-Lord's got taste,
      seemingly. But take care, your Honour; take care! 'Thou shalt not covet
      thy neighbour's wife, nor his ox, nor his ass'&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip laughed noisily. The miserable man was writhing in his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take an old fiddler's advice, Deemster&mdash;have nothing to do with the
      women. When they're young they're kittens to play with you, but when
      they're old they're cats to scratch you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete twisted his body until the whole breadth of his back blocked the
      parson from Philip's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fortnight ago, you were saying, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fortnight,&rdquo; muttered Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There'll be daisies growing on her grave by this time,&rdquo; said Pete softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson had put up his nose-glasses. &ldquo;Who's this fellow, Crow? Captain&mdash;what?
      His honour's cousin? <i>Cousin?</i> Oh, of course&mdash;yes&mdash;I
      remember&mdash;Tynwald&mdash;ah&mdash;h'm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The coach set down its passengers in the market-place. Pete inquired the
      hour of its return journey, and was told that it started back at six. He
      helped the girl to alight, and directed her to the pier, where a crowd of
      people' were awaiting the arrival of the steamer. Then he rejoined Philip,
      who led the way through the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Deemster was observed by everybody. As he passed along the streets
      there was much whispering and nudging, and some bowing and lifting of
      hats. He responded to none of it He recognised no one. He, who was famous
      for courtesy, renowned for gracious manners, beloved for a smile like
      sunshine&mdash;the brighter and more winsome when it broke as from a cloud&mdash;returned
      no man's salutation that day, and replied to no woman's greeting. His face
      was set hard like a marble mask. It passed along without appearing to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete walked one step behind. They did not speak as they went through the
      town. Not a word or a sign passed between them. Philip turned into a side
      street, and drew up at an iron gate which opened on to a churchyard. They
      were at the churchyard of St. George's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the place,&rdquo; said Philip huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete took off his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gate was partly open. It was Saturday, and the organist was alone in
      the church practising hymns for Sunday's services. They passed through.
    </p>
    <p>
      The churchyard was an oblong enclosure within high walls, overlooked on
      its long sides by rows of houses. One of these rows was Athol Street, and
      one of the houses was the Deemster's.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late afternoon by this time. Long shadows were cast eastward from
      the tombstones; the horizontal sunlight was making the leaves very light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip walked noisily, jerkily, irregularly, like a man conscious of
      weakness and determined to conquer it. Pete walked behind, so softly that
      his foot on the gravel was hardly to be heard. The organist was playing
      Cowper's familiar hymn&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;God moves in a mysterious way
          His wonders to perform.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      There was a broad avenue, bordered by railed tombs, leading to the
      church-door. Philip turned out of this into a narrow path which went
      through a bare green space, that was dotted with pegs of wood and little
      unhewn slabs of slate, like an abandoned quoit ground. At the farthest
      corner of this space he stopped before a mound near to the wall. It was
      the new-made grave. The scars of the turf were still unhealed, and the
      glist of the spade was on the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip hesitated a moment, and looked round at Pete, as if even then, even
      there, he would confess. But he saw no escape from the mesh of his own
      lies, and with a deep, breath of submission he pointed down, turned his
      head over his shoulder, and said in a strange voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The silence was long and awful. At length Pete said in a broken whisper&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lave me, sir, lave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip turned away, breathing audibly. A moment longer Pete stood where he
      was, gripping his hat with both hands in front of him. Then he went down
      on his knees. &ldquo;Oh, forgive me my hard thoughts of thee,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Jesus,
      forgive me my hard thoughts of my poor Kirry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip heard no more. The organ was very loud and triumphant.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Deep in unfathomable mines
          Of never-failing skill,
     He treasures up His bright designs
          And works His sovereign will.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      A red shaft of sunlight tipped down on Pete's uncovered head from the top
      of the wall. The blessed tears had come to him. He was sobbing aloud; he
      was alone with his love at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was alone with her indeed. At that moment Kate was looking down from
      the window of her room. She saw him kneeling and praying by another's
      grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip never knew how he got out of the churchyard. He crawled out&mdash;creeping
      along by the wall, and slinking through the gate&mdash;heart-sick and all
      but heart-dead. When he came to himself, he was standing in Athol Street,
      and a company of jolly fellows in a jaunting-car, driving out of the
      golden sunset, were rattling past him with shouts and peals of laughter.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kate was standing in her room with the door open, beating her hands
      together in the first helpless stupor of fear, when she saw a man coming
      up the stairs. His legs seemed to be giving way as he ascended; he was
      bent and feeble, and had all the look of great age. As he approached he
      lifted his face, which was old and withered. Then she saw who it was. It
      was Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made an involuntary cry, and he smiled upon her&mdash;a hard, frozen,
      terrible smile. &ldquo;He is lost,&rdquo; she thought. Her scared expression
      penetrated to his soul. He knew that she had seen everything. At first he
      tried to speak, but he could utter nothing. Then a mad desire seized him
      to lay hold of her&mdash;by the arms, by the shoulders, by the throat.
      Conquering this impulse, he stood motionless, passing his hands through
      his hair. She dropped her eyes and hung her head. Their abasement in each
      other's eyes was complete. He was ashamed before her, she was ashamed
      before him. One moment they faced each other thus, in silence, in pitiless
      and awful silence, and then slowly, very slowly, stupefied and crushed, he
      turned away and crept out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the end&mdash;the end.&rdquo; What was the use of going farther? He had
      fallen too low. His degradation was abject. It was hopeless, irreparable,
      irremediable. &ldquo;End it all&mdash;end it all.&rdquo; The words clamoured in his
      inmost soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halting down the quay, he made for the ferry steps, where boats were
      waiting for hire. He had lately hired one of an evening, and pulled round
      the Head for the sake of the breath and the silence of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going far out this evening, your Honor?&rdquo; the boatman asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farther than ever,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pull, pull! Away from the terrible past. Away from the horrible present.
      The steamer had arrived, and had discharged her passengers. She was still
      pulsing at the end of the red pier like a horse that pants after running a
      race.
    </p>
    <p>
      A band was playing a waltz somewhere on the promenade. Pleasure boats were
      darting about the bay. Sea-birds were sitting on the water where the
      sewers of the gay little town empty into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pull, pull! He was flying from remorse, from despair, from the deep
      duplicity of a double life, from the lie that had slain the heart of a
      living man. How low he had fallen! Could he fall lower without falling
      into crime?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pull, pull! He would be a criminal next. When a man had been degraded in
      his own eyes, and in the eyes of her he loved, crime stood beckoning him.
      He might try, but he could not resist; he must yield, he must fall. It was
      the only degradation remaining. Better end everything before dropping into
      that last abyss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pull, pull! He was the judge of his island, and he had outraged justice.
      Holding a false title, living on a false honour, he was safe of no man's
      respect, secure of no woman's goodwill. Exposure hung over him. He would
      be disgraced, the law would be disgraced, the island would be disgraced.
      Pull, pull, pull, before it is too late; out, far out, farther than tide
      returns, or sea tells stories to the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had rowed like a slave escaping from his chains, in terror of being
      overtaken and dragged back. The voices of the harbour were now hushed, the
      music of the band was deadened, the horses running along the promenade
      seemed to creep like ants, and the traffic of the streets was no louder
      than a dull subterranean rumble. He had shot out of the margin of smooth
      blue water in which the island lay as on a mirror, and out of the shadow
      of the hill upon the bay. The sea about him now was running green and
      glistening, and the red sun-? light was coming down on it like smoke. Only
      the steeples and towers and glass domes of the town reached up into
      luminous air. He could see the squat tower of St. George's silhouetted
      against the dying glory of the sky. Seven years he had been its neighbour,
      and it had witnessed such happy and such cruel hours. All the joy of work,
      the sweetness of success, the dreams of greatness, the rosy flushes of
      love, and then&mdash;the tortures of conscience, the visions, the horror,
      the secret shame, the self-abandonment, and, last of all, the twofold
      existence as of husband with wife, hidden, incomplete, unfulfilled, yet
      full of tender ties which had seemed like galling bonds so many a time,
      but were now so sweet when the hour had come to break them.
    </p>
    <p>
      How distant it all appeared to be! And was he flying from the island like
      this? The island that had honoured him, that had rewarded him beyond his
      deserts, and earlier than his dreams, that had suffered no jealousy to
      impede him, no rivalry to fret him, no disparity of age and service to
      hold him back&mdash;the little island that had seemed to open its arms to
      him, and to cry, &ldquo;Philip Christian, son of your father, grandson of your
      grandfather, first of Manxmen, come up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, for what might have been! Useless regrets! Pull, pull, and forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the home of his childhood! Ballure&mdash;Auntie Nan&mdash;his father's
      death brightened by one hope&mdash;the last, but ah! how vain!&mdash;Port
      Mooar&mdash;Pete, &ldquo;The sea's calling me.&rdquo; Pull, pull! The sea was calling
      him indeed. Calling him to the deep womb that is death, not birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was far out. The sun had gone, the island was like a bird of ashy grey
      stretched across the horizon; the great wing of night was coming down from
      the sky, and up out the mysterious depths of the sea came the profound
      hum, the mighty voice that is the organ of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took in the oars, and his tiny shell began to drift At that moment his
      eye caught something at the bottom of the boat. It was a flower, a broken
      stem, a torn rose, and a few scattered rose leaves. Only a relic of the
      last occupants, but it brought back the perfume of love, a sense of
      tenderness, of bright eyes, of a caress, a kiss. His mind went back to
      Sulby, to the Melliah, to the glen, to the days so full of tremulous love,
      when they hovered on the edge of the precipice. They had been hurled over
      it since then. It was some relief that between love and honour he would
      not have to struggle any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Kate? When all was over and word went round, &ldquo;The Deemster is gone,&rdquo;
       what would happen to Kate? She would still be at his house in Athol
      Street. That would be the beginning of evil! She would wait for him, and
      when hope of his return was lost, she would weep for him. That would be
      the key of discovery! The truth would become known. Though he might be at
      the bottom of the sea, yet the cloud that hung over his life would break.
      It was inevitable. And she would be there to bear the storm alone&mdash;alone
      with the island which had been deceived, alone with Pete, who had been
      lied to and betrayed. Was that just? Was that brave?
    </p>
    <p>
      And then&mdash;what then? What would become of her? Openly shamed,
      charged, as she must be, with the whole weight of the crime from whose
      burden he had fled, accused of his downfall, a Delilah, a Jezebel, what
      fate should befall her? Where would she go? Down to what depths? He saw
      her sinking lower than ever man sinks; he heard her appeals, her
      supplications.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what have I done,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that I can neither live nor die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then in that delirium of anguish in which the order of nature is reversed,
      and external objects no longer produce sensation, but sensation produces,
      as it were, external objects, he thought he saw something at the bottom of
      the boat where the broken rose had been. It was the figure of a man,
      stretched out, still and lifeless. His eyes went up to the face. The face
      was his own. It was ashy grey, and it stared up at the grey sky. The brain
      image was himself, and he was dead. He watched it, and it faded away.
      There was nothing left but the scattered rose-leaves and the torn flower
      on the broken stem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terrible shadow was gone; he felt that it was gone for ever. It was
      dead, and it would haunt him no longer. It had lived on an empire of
      evil-doing, and his evil-doing was at an end. He would &ldquo;see his soul&rdquo; no
      more. The tears gushed to his eyes and blinded him. They were the first he
      could remember since he was a boy. Alone between the two mirrors of sea
      and sky, the chain that he had dragged so long fell: away from him. He was
      a free man again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back! your place is by her side. Don't sneak out of life, and leave
      another to pay. Suffering is a grand thing. It is the struggle of the soul
      to cast off its sin. Accept it, go through with it, come out of it purged.
      Go back to the island. Your life is not ended yet.&rdquo;
     </p>

      XXIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were just going sending a lil yawl after you, Dempster, when we were
      seeing you a bit overside the head yonder coming back. 'He's drifting home
      on the flowing tide,' says I, and so you were. Must have been a middling
      stiff pull for all. We were thinking you were lost one while there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>was</i> almost lost, but I'm here again, thank God,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke cheerily, and went away with a light step. It was now full night;
      the town was lit up, and the musicians of the pavement were twanging their
      banjos and harps. Philip felt a sort of physical regeneration, a renewal
      of youth, a new birth of heart and hope. He was like a man coming out of
      some hideous Gehenna of delirious illness; he though he had never been so
      light, so buoyant, so happy in his life before. The future was vague. He
      did not yet know what he would do. It would be something radical,
      something that would go down to the heart of his condition. Oh, he would
      be strong, he would be resolute, he would pay the uttermost farthing, he
      would not wait to count the cost. And she&mdash;she would be with him. He
      could do nothing without her. The partner of his fault would share his
      redemption also. God bless her!

    <p>
      He let himself into the house and shut the door firmly behind him. The
      lights were still burning in the hall, so it was not very late. He mounted
      the stairs with a loud step and swung into his room. The lamp was on the
      table, and within the circle cast by its blue shade a letter was lying. He
      took it up with dismay. It was in Kate's handwriting:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me! I am going away. It is all my fault. I have broken the heart
      of one man, and I am destroying the soul of another. If I stay here any
      longer you will be ruined and lost. I am only a millstone about your neck.
      I see it, I feel it. And yet I have loved you so, and wished to be so
      proud of you. Your heart is brave enough, though I have sunk it down so
      low. You will live to be strong and good and true, though that can never
      be while I am with you. I have been far below you from the first. All
      along I have only been thinking how much I loved you, but you have had so
      many other things to consider. My life seems to have been one long battle
      for love. I think it has been a cruel battle too. Anyway, I am beaten, and
      oh! so tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not follow me. I pray of you do not try to find me. It is my last
      request. Think of me as on a long journey. I may be&mdash;the Great God of
      heaven knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am taking the little cracked medallion from the bottom of the oak box.
      It is the only picture I can find, and it will remind me of some one else
      as well&mdash;my little Katherine, my motherless baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to leave with you but this (<i>it was a lock of her hair</i>).
      At first I thought of the wedding-ring that you gave me when I came here,
      but it would not come off, and besides, I could not part with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye! I ought to have done this long ago. But you will not hate me
      now? We could never be happy together again. Good-bye!&rdquo;

      I.

    <p>
      The summer had gone, the gorse had dried up, the herring-fishing had
      ended, and Pete had become poor. His Nickey had done nothing, his last
      hundred pounds had been spent, and his creditors in scores, quiet as mice
      until then, were baying about him like bloodhounds. He sold his boat and
      satisfied everybody, but fell, nevertheless, to the position of a person
      of no credit and little consequence. On the lips of the people he
      descended from &ldquo;Capt'n Pete&rdquo; to Peter Bridget. When he saluted the rich
      with &ldquo;How do!&rdquo; they replied with a stare, a lift of the chin, and &ldquo;You've
      the odds of me, my good man.&rdquo; To this he replied, with a roll of the head
      and a peal of laughter, &ldquo;Have I now? But you'll die for all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ballajora Chapel had been three months rehearsing a children's cantata
      entitled &ldquo;Under the Palms,&rdquo; and building an arbour of palm branches on a
      platform for Pete's rugged form to figure in; but Cæsar sat there instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, Pete had his six thousand pounds in mortgage on Ballawhaine. Only
      three other persons knew anything of that&mdash;Cæsar, who had his own
      reasons for saying nothing; Peter Christian himself, who was hardly likely
      to tell; and the High Bailiff, who was a bachelor and a miser, and kept
      all business revelations as sacred as are the secrets of another kind of
      confessional. When Pete's evil day came and the world showed no pity,
      Cæsar became afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't sell out, sir,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Hould on till Martinmas, anyway. The
      first half year's interest is due then. There's no knowing what'll happen
      before that. What's it saying, 'He shall give His angels charge concerning
      thee.' The ould man has had a polatic stroke, they're telling me. Aw, the
      Lord's mercy endureth for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete began to sell his furniture. He cleared out the parlour as bare as a
      vault. &ldquo;Time for it, too,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I've been wanting the room for a
      workshop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martinmas came, and Cæsar returned in high feather. &ldquo;No interest,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Give him the month's grace, and hould hard till it's over. The Lord
      will provide. Isn't it written, 'In the world ye shall have tribulation'?
      Things are doing wonderful, though. Last night going home from Ballajora,
      I saw the corpse-lights coming from the big house to Kirk Christ's
      Churchyard, with the parson psalming in front of them. The ould man's
      dying&mdash;-I've seen his soul. To thy name, O Lord, be all the glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete sold out a second room, and turned the key on it. &ldquo;Mortal cosy and
      small this big, ugly mansion is getting, Nancy,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The month's grace allowed by the deed of mortgage expired, and Cæsar came
      to Elm Cottage rubbing both hands. &ldquo;Turn him out, neck and crop, sir. Not
      a penny left to the man, and six thousand goolden pounds paid into his
      hands seven months ago. But who's wondering at that? There's Ross back
      again, carrying half a ton of his friends over the island, and lashing out
      the silver like dust. <i>Your</i> silver, sir, <i>yours</i>. And here's
      yourself, with the world darkening round you terrible. But no fear of you
      now. The meek shall inherit the earth. Aw, God is opening His word more
      and more, sir, more and more. There's that Black Tom too. He was talking
      big a piece back, but this morning he was up before the High Bailiff for
      charming and cheating, and was put away for the Dempster. Lord keep him
      from the gallows and hell-fire! Oh, it's a refreshing saison. It was God
      spaking to me by Providence when I tould you to put money on that
      mortgage. What's the Scripture saying, 'For brass I bring thee goold'?
      Turn him out, sir, turn him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you tell me that ould Ballawhaine had a polatic stroke?&rdquo; said
      Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did; but he's a big man; let him pay his way,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Samson was a strong man, and Solomon was a wise one, but they couldn't
      pay money when they hadn't got it,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him look to his son then,&rdquo; said Cæsar&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just what he's going to do,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;I'll let him die in his
      bed, God forgive him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The winter came, and Pete began to think of buying a Dandie, which being
      smaller than a Nickey, and of yawl rig, he could sail of himself, and so
      earn a living by fishing the cod. To do this he had a further clearing of
      furniture, thereby reducing the size of the house to three rooms. The
      featherbed left his own bedstead, the watch came out of his pocket, and
      the walls of the hall-kitchen gaped and yawned in the places where the
      pictures had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bog-bane to the rushy curragh, say I, Nancy,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Not being
      used of such grandeur, I was taking it hard. Never could remember to wind
      that watch. And feathers, bless you! Don't I remember the lil mother, with
      a sickle and a bag, going cutting the long grass on the steep brews for
      the cow, and drying a handful for myself for a bed. Sleeping on it? Never
      slept the like since at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The result of Pete's first week's fishing was twenty cod and a gigantic
      ling. He packed the cod in boxes and sent them by Crow and the
      steam-packet to the market in Liverpool. The ling he swung on his back
      over his oilskin jacket and carried it home, the head at his shoulder and
      the tail dangling at his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he cried, dropping it on the floor, &ldquo;split it and salt it, and
      you've breakfas'es for a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the remittance came from Liverpool it was a postal order for
      seven-and-sixpence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Pete; &ldquo;we're bating Dan Hommy anyway&mdash;the ould
      muff has only made seven-and-a-penny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The weather was rough, the fishing was bad, the tackle got broken, and
      Pete began to extol plain living.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gough bless me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don't know in the world what's coming to the
      ould island at all. When I was for a man-servant with Cæsar the farming
      boys were ateing potatoes and herrings three times a day. But now!
      butcher's mate every dinner-time, if you plaze. And tay! the girls must be
      having it reg'lar&mdash;and taking no shame with them neither. My sake, I
      remember when the mother would be whispering, 'Keep an eye on the road,
      boy, while I'm brewing myself a cup of tay.' Truth enough, Nancy. An ounce
      a week and a pound of sugar, and people wondering at the woman for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mountains were taken from the people, and they were no longer allowed
      &ldquo;to cut turf for fuel; coals were dear, the winter was cold, and Pete
      began to complain of a loss of appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My teeth must be getting bad, Nancy,&rdquo; he whined. They were white as milk
      and faultless as a negro's. &ldquo;Don't domesticate my food somehow. What's the
      odds, though I Can't ate suppers at all, and that's some constilation.
      Nothing like going to bed hungry, Nancy, if you're wanting to get up with
      an appetite for breakfast. Then the beautiful drames, woman! Gough bless
      me, the dinners and the feasts and the bankets you're ateing in your
      sleep! Now, if you filled your skin like a High Bailiff afore going to
      bed, ten to one you'd have a buggane riding on your breast the night
      through and drame of dying for a drink of water. Aw, sleep's a reg'lar
      Radical Good for levelling up, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christmas approached, servants boasted of the Christmas boxes they got
      from their masters, and Pete remembered Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;they're telling me Liza Billy-ny-Clae is getting twenty
      pound per year per annum at her new situation in Douglas. She isn't
      nothing to yourself at cooking. Mustn't let the lil one stand in your way,
      woman. She's getting a big girl now, and I'll be taking her out in the
      Dandie with me and tying her down on the low deck there and giving her a
      pig's bladder, and she'll be playing away as nice as nice. See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy looked at him, and he dropped his eyes before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it wanting to get done with me, you are, Pete?&rdquo; she said in a
      quavering voice. &ldquo;There's my black&mdash;I can sell it for something&mdash;it's
      never been wore at me since I sat through the sarvice with Grannie the
      Sunday after we got news of Kirry. And I'm not a big eater, Pete&mdash;never
      was&mdash;you can clear me of that anyway. A bit of bread and cheese for
      my dinner when you are out at the fishing, and I'm asking no better&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hould your tongue, woman,&rdquo; cried Pete. &ldquo;Hould your tongue afore you break
      my heart I've seen my rich days and I've seen my poor days. I've tried
      both, and I'm content.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meantime, Philip in Douglas was going from success to success, from rank
      to rank, from fame to fame. Everything he put his hand to counted to him
      for righteousness. When he came to himself after the disappearance of
      Kate, his heart was a wasted field of volcanic action, with ashes and
      scoriae of infernal blackness on the surface, but the wholesome soil
      beneath. In spite of her injunction, he set himself to look for her. More
      than love, more than pity, more than remorse prompted and supported him.
      She was necessary to his resurrection, to his new birth. So he scoured
      every poor quarter of the town, every rookery of old Douglas, and this was
      set down to an interest in the poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      An epidemic broke out on the island, and during the scare that followed,
      wherein some of the wealthy left their homes for England, and many of the
      poor betook themselves to the mountains, and even certain of the doctors
      found refuge in flight, Philip won golden opinions for presence of mind
      and personal courage. He organised a system of registration, regulated
      quarantine, and caused the examination of everybody coming to the island
      or leaving it. From day to day he went from house to house, from hospital
      to hospital, from ward to ward. No dangers terrified him; he seemed to
      keep his eye on each case. He was only looking for Kate, only assuring
      himself that she had not fallen victim to the pest, only making certain
      that she had not come or gone. But the divine madness which seizes upon a
      crowd when its heart is touched laid hold of the island at the sight of
      Philip's activities. He was worshipped, he was beloved, he was the idol of
      the poor, almost everybody else was forgotten in the splendour of his
      fame; no committee could proceed without him; no list was complete until
      it included his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was ashamed of his glories, but he had no heart to repudiate them.
      When the epidemic subsided, he had convinced himself that Kate must be
      gone, that she must be dead. Gone, therefore, was his only hold on life,
      and dead was his hope of a moral resurrection. He could do nothing without
      her but go on as he was going. To pretend to a new birth now would be like
      a death-bed conversion; it would be like renouncing the joys of life after
      they have renounced the renouncer.
    </p>
    <p>
      His colleague, the old Deemster, was stricken down by paralysis, and he
      was required to attend to both their duties. This made it necessary at
      first that all Deemster's Courts should be held in Castletown, and hence
      Ramsey saw him rarely. He spent his days in the Court-house of the Castle
      and his nights at home. His fair hair became prematurely white, and his
      face grew more than ever like that of a man newly risen from a fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Study,&rdquo; said the world, and it bowed its head the lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he was seen to be not only a studious man, but a melancholy one. To
      defeat curiosity, he began to enter a little into the life of the island,
      and, as time went on, to engage in some of the social duties of his
      official position. On Christmas Eve he gave a reception at his house in
      Athol Street. He had hardly realised how it would tear at the tenderest
      fibres of memory. The very rooms that had been Kate's were given over to
      the ladies who were his guests. All afternoon the crush was great, and the
      host was the attraction. He was a fascinating figure&mdash;so young, yet
      already so high; so silent, yet able to speak so splendidly; and then so
      handsome with that whitening head, and that smile like vanishing sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the reception, Philip received a letter from Ramsey that
      was like the cry of a bleeding heart:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lil one is ill theyr sayin shes Diein cum to me for gods. sake.&mdash;Peat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The snow was beginning to fall as the guests departed. When the last of
      them was gone, the clock on the bureau was striking six, and the night was
      closing in. By eight o'clock Philip was at Elm Cottage.
    </p>

      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </div>
    <h2>
      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pete was sitting at the foot of the stairs, unwashed, uncombed, with his
      clothes half buttoned and his shoes unlaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phil!&rdquo; he cried, and leaping up he took Philip by both hands and fell to
      sobbing like a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went upstairs together. The bedroom was dense with steam, and the
      forms of two women were floating like figures in a fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There she is, the bogh,&rdquo; cried Pete in a pitiful wail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child lay outstretched on Grannie's lap, with no sign of
      consciousness, and hardly any sign of life, except the hollow breathing of
      bronchitis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip felt a strange emotion come over him. He sat on the end of the bed
      and looked down. The little face, with its twitching mouth and pinched
      nostrils, beating with every breath, was the face of Kate. The little
      head, with its round forehead and the silvery hair brushed back from the
      temples, was his own head. A mysterious throb surprised him, a great
      tenderness, a deep yearning, something new to him, and born as it were in
      his breast at that instant. He had an impulse, never felt before, to go
      down on his knees where the child lay, to take it in his arms, to draw it
      to him, to fondle it, to call it his own, and to pour over it the
      inarticulate babble of pain and love that was bursting from his tongue.
      But some one was kneeling there already, and in his jealous longing he
      realised that his passionate sorrow could have no voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete, at Grannie's lap, was stroking the child's arm and her forehead with
      the tenderness of a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bogh millish! Seems aisier now, doesn't she, Grannie? Quieter,
      anyway? Not coughing so much, is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor came at the moment, and Cæsar entered the room behind him with
      a face of funereal resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See,&rdquo; cried Pete; &ldquo;there's your lil patient, doctor. She's lying as quiet
      as quiet, and hasn't coughed to spake of for better than an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm!&rdquo; said the doctor ominously. He looked at the child, made some
      inquiries of Grannie, gave certain instructions to Nancy, and then lifted
      his head with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we've done all we can for her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If the child lives
      through the night she may get over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The women threw up their hands with &ldquo;Aw, dear, aw, dear!&rdquo; Philip gave a
      low, sharp cry of pain; but Pete, who had been breathing heavily, watching
      intently, and holding his arms about the little one as if he would save it
      from disease and death and heaven itself, now lost himself in the
      immensity of his woe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, doctor, what are you saying?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You were always took for a
      knowledgable man, doctor; but you're talking nonsense now. Don't you see
      the child's only sleeping comfortable? And haven't I told you she hasn't
      coughed anything worth for an hour? Do you think a poor fellow's got no
      sense at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was a patient man as well as a wise one&mdash;he left the room
      without a word. But, thinking to pour oil on Pete's wounds, and not
      minding that his oil was vitriol, Cæsar said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it's the Lord's will, it's His will, sir. The sins of the fathers are
      visited upon the children&mdash;yes, and the mothers, too, God forgive
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that Pete leapt to his feet in a flame of wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie! you lie!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;God doesn't punish the innocent for the
      guilty. If He does, He's not a good God but a bad one. Why should this
      child be made to suffer and die for the sin of its mother? Aye, or its
      father either? Show me the <i>man</i> that would make it do the like, and
      I'll smash his head against the wall. Blaspheming, am I? No, but it's you
      that's blaspheming. God is good, God is just, God is in heaven, and you
      are making Him out no God at all, but worse than the blackest devil that's
      in hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar went off in horror of Pete's profanities. &ldquo;If the Lord keep not the
      city,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the watchman waketh in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete's loud voice had aroused the child. It made a little cry, and he was
      all softness in an instant. The women moistened its lips with
      barley-water, and hushed its fretful whimper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Philip, taking Pete's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me lean on you, Philip,&rdquo; said Pete, and the stalwart fellow went
      tottering down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat on opposite sides of the fireplace, and kept the staircase door
      open that they might hear all that happened in the room above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get thee to bed, Nancy,&rdquo; said the voice of Grannie. &ldquo;Dear knows how soon
      you'll be wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be calling me for twelve, then, Grannie&mdash;now, mind, you'll be
      calling me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Pete! He's not so far wrong, though. What's it saying? 'Suffer lil
      childers'&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Cæsar's right enough this time, Grannie. The bogh is took for death
      as sure as sure. I saw the crow that was at the wedding going crossing the
      child's head the very last time she was out of doors.&rdquo; Pete was listening
      intently. Philip was gazing passively into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't help it, sir&mdash;I couldn't really,&rdquo; whispered Pete across
      the hearth. &ldquo;When a man's got a child that's ill, they may talk about
      saving souls, but what's the constilation in that? It's not the soul he's
      wanting saving at all, it's the child&mdash;now, isn't it, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip made some confused response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coorse, I can't expect you to understand that, Philip. You're a grand
      man, and a clever man, and a feeling man, but I can't expect you to
      understand that&mdash;now, is it likely? The greenest gall's egg of a
      father that isn't half wise has the pull of you there, Phil. 'Deed he has,
      though. When a man has a child of his own he's knowing what it manes, the
      Lord help him. Something calls to him&mdash;it's like blood calling to
      blood&mdash;it's like... I don't know that I'm understanding it myself,
      neither&mdash;not to say <i>understand</i> exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every word that Pete spoke was like a sword turning both ways. Philip drew
      his breath heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can feel for another, Phil&mdash;the Lord forbid you should ever feel
      for yourself. Books are <i>your</i> children, and they're best off that's
      never having no better. But the lil ones&mdash;God help them&mdash;to see
      them fail, and suffer, and sink&mdash;and you not able to do nothing&mdash;and
      themselves calling to you&mdash;calling still&mdash;calling reg'lar&mdash;calling
      out of mercy&mdash;the way I am telling of, any way&mdash;O God! O God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip's throat rose. He felt as if he must betray himself the next
      instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the doctor was right for all. Maybe the child isn't willing to
      stay with us now the mother is gone; maybe it's wanting away, poor thing.
      And who knows? Wouldn't trust but the mother is waiting for the lil bogh
      yonder&mdash;waiting and waiting on the shore there, and 'ticing and
      'ticing&mdash;-I've heard of the like, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip groaned. His brain reeled; his legs grew cold as stones. A great
      awe came over him. It was not Pete alone that he was encountering. In
      these searchings and rendings of the heart, which uncovered every thought
      and tore open every wound, he was entering the lists with God himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church bell began to ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; cried Philip. It had struck upon his ear like a knell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Oiel Verree</i>,&rdquo; said Pete. The bell was ringing for the old Manx
      service for the singing of Christmas carols. The fibres of Pete's memory
      were touched by it. He told of his Christmases abroad&mdash;how it was
      summer instead of winter, and fruits were on the trees instead of snow on
      the ground&mdash;how people who had never spoken to him before would shake
      hands and wish him a merry Christmas. Then from sheer weariness and a
      sense of utter desolation, broken by the comfort of Philip's company, he
      fell asleep in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night wore on; the house was quiet; only the husky rasping of the
      child's hurried breathing came from the floor above.
    </p>
    <p>
      An evil thought in the guise of a pious one took possession of Philip.
      &ldquo;God is wise,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;God is merciful. He knows what is best
      for all of us. What are we poor impotent grasshoppers, that we dare pray
      to Him to change His great purposes? It is idle. It is impious.... While
      the child lives there will be security for no one. If it dies, there will
      be peace and rest and the beginning of content. The mother must be gone
      already, so the dark chapter of our lives will be closed at last God is
      all wise. God is all good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child made a feeble cry, and Philip crept upstairs to look. Grannie
      had dozed off in her seat, and little Katherine was on the bed. A
      disregarded doll lay with inverted head on the counterpane. The fire had
      slid and died down to a lifeless glow, and the kettle had ceased to steam.
      There was no noise in the room save the child's galloping breathing, which
      seemed to scrape the walls as with a file. Sometimes there was a cough
      that came like a voice through a fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip crept in noiselessly, knelt down by the bed-head, and leaned over
      the pillow. A candle which burned on the mantelpiece cast its light on the
      head that lay there. The little face was drawn, the little pinched
      nostrils were beating like a pulse, the little lip beneath was beaded with
      perspiration, the beautiful round forehead was damp, and the silken
      silvery hair was matted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip thought the child must be dying, and his ugly piety gave way. There
      was a movement on the bed. One little hand that had been clenched hard on
      the breast came over the counterpane and fell, outstretched and open
      before him. He took it for an appeal, a dumb and piteous appeal, and the
      smothered tenderness of the father's heart came uppermost. <i>Her</i>
      child, his child, dying, and he there, yet not daring to claim her!
    </p>
    <p>
      A new fear took hold of him. He had been wrong&mdash;there could be no
      security in the child's death, no peace, no rest, no content. As surely as
      the child died he would betray himself. He would blurt it all out; he
      would tell everything. &ldquo;My child! my darling! my Kate's Kate!&rdquo; The cry
      would burst from him. He could not help it. And to reveal the black secret
      at the mouth of an open grave would be terrible, it would be horrible, it
      would be awful, &ldquo;Spare her, O Lord, spare her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a fear bordering on delirium he went downstairs and shook Pete by the
      shoulders to awaken him. &ldquo;Come quickly,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete opened his eyes with a bewildered look» &ldquo;She's better, isn't she?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she worse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's life or death now. We must try something that I saw when I was
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord, and I've been sleeping! Save her, Philip! You're great; your
      clever&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, for God's sake, my good fellow! Quick, a kettle of boiling
      water&mdash;a blanket&mdash;some hot towels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you're a friend, you'll save her. The doctors don't know nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes afterwards the child made a feeble cry, coughed loosely, threw
      up phlegm, and came out of the drowsy land which it had inhabited for a
      week. In ten minutes more it was wrapped in the hot towels and sitting on
      Pete's knee before a brisk are, opening its little eyes and pursing its
      little mouth, and making some inarticulate communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Grannie awoke with a start, and reproached herself for sleeping. &ldquo;But
      dear heart alive,&rdquo; she cried, with both hands up, &ldquo;the bogh villish is
      mended wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy came back in her stockings, blinking and yawning. She clapped and
      crowed at sight of the child's altered face. The clock in the kitchen was
      striking twelve by this time, the bells had begun to ring again, the carol
      singers were coming out of the church, there was a sound on the light snow
      of the street like the running of a shallow river, and the waits were
      being sung for the dawn of another Christmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor looked in on his way home, and congratulated himself on the
      improved condition. The crisis was passed, the child was safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! better, better,&rdquo; he said cheerily. &ldquo;I thought we might manage it this
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the Dempster that done it,&rdquo; cried Pete. He was cooing and blowing
      at little Katherine over the fringe of her towels. &ldquo;He couldn't have done
      more for the lil one if she'd been his own flesh and blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip dared not speak. He hurried away in a storm of emotion. &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo;
       he thought, &ldquo;not yet.&rdquo; The time of his discovery was not yet. It was like
      Death, though&mdash;it waited for him somewhere. Somewhere and at some
      time&mdash;some day in the year, some place on the earth. Perhaps his eyes
      knew the date in the calendar, perhaps his feet knew the spot on the land,
      yet he knew neither. Somewhere and at some time&mdash;God knew where&mdash;God
      knew when&mdash;He kept his own secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Philip slept at the &ldquo;Mitre,&rdquo; and next morning he went up to
      Ballure.

    <h2>
      IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Governor could not forget Tynwald. Exaggerating the humiliation of
      that day, he thought his influence in the island was gone. He sold his
      horses and carriages, and otherwise behaved like a man who expected to be
      recalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards Philip he showed no malice. It was not merely as the author of his
      shame that Philip had disappointed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had half cherished a hope that Philip would become his son-in-law. But
      when the rod in his hand had failed him, when it proved too big for a
      staff and too rough for a crutch, he did not attempt to break it. Either
      from the instinct of a gentleman, or the pride of a strong man, he
      continued to shower his favours upon Philip. Going to London with his wife
      and daughter at the beginning of the new year, he appointed Philip to act
      as his deputy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip did not abuse his powers. As grandson of the one great Manxman of
      his century, and himself a man of talents, he was readily accepted by the
      island. His only drawback was his settled melancholy. This added to his
      interest if it took from his popularity. The ladies began to whisper that
      he had fallen in love, and that his heart was &ldquo;buried in the grave.&rdquo; He
      did not forget old comrades. It was remembered, in his favour, that one of
      his friends was a fisherman, a cousin across the bar of bastardy, who had
      been a fool and gone through his fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      On St. Bridget's Day Philip held Deemster's Court in Ramsey. The snow had
      gone and the earth had the smell of violets. It was almost as if the
      violets themselves lay close beneath the soil, and their odour had been
      too long kept under. The sun, which had not been seen for weeks, had burst
      out that day; the air was warm, and the sky was blue. Inside the
      Court-house the upper arcs of the windows had been let down; the sun shone
      on the Deemster as he sat on the dais, and the spring breeze played with
      his silvery wig. Some^ times, in the pauses of rasping voices, the birds
      were heard to sing from the trees on the lawn outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial was a tedious and protracted one. It was the trial of Black Tom.
      During the epidemic that had visited the island he had developed the
      character of a witch doctor. His first appearance in Court had been before
      the High Bailiff, who had committed him to prison. He had been bailed out
      by Pete, and had forfeited his bail in an attempt at flight. The witnesses
      were now many, and some came from a long distance. It was desirable to
      conclude the same day. At five in the evening the Deemster rose and said,
      &ldquo;The Court will adjourn for an hour, gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip took his own refreshments in the Deemster's room&mdash;Jem-y-Lord
      was with him&mdash;then put off his wig and gown, and slipped through the
      prisoners' yard at the back and round the corner to Elm Cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now quite dark. The house was lit by the firelight only, which
      flashed like Will-o'-the-wisp on the hall window. Philip was surprised by
      unusual sounds. There was laughter within, then singing, and then laughter
      again. He bad reached the porch and his approach had not been heard. The
      door stood open and he looked in and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was barer than he had ever seen it&mdash;a table, three chairs, a
      cradle, a dresser, and a corner cupboard. Nancy sat by the fire with the
      child on her lap. Pete was squatting on the floor, which was strewn with
      rushes, and singing&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Come, Bridget, Saint Bridget, come in at my door,
     The crock's on the bink, and the rush is on the floor.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then getting on to all fours like a great boy, and bobbing his head up and
      down and making deep growls to imitate the terrors of a wild beast, he
      made little runs and plunges at the child, who jumped and crowed in
      Nancy's lap and laughed and squealed till she &ldquo;kinked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, stop, you great omathaun, stop,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;It isn't good for the
      lil one&mdash;'deed it isn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Pete was too greedy of the child's joy to deny himself the delight of
      it. Making a great low sweep of the room, he came back hopping on his
      haunches and barking like a dog. Then the child laughed till the laughter
      rolled like a marble in her little throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip's own throat rose at the sight, and his breast began to ache. He
      felt the same thrill as before&mdash;the same, yet different, more
      painful, more full of jealous longing. This was no place for him. He
      thought he would go away. But turning on his heel, he was seen by Pete,
      who was now on his back on the floor, rocking the child up and down like
      the bellows of an accordion, and to and fro like the sleigh of a loom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My faith, the Dempster! Come in, sir, come in,&rdquo; cried Pete, looking over
      his forehead. Then, giving the child back to Nancy, he leapt to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip entered with a sick yearning and sat down in the chair facing
      Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're wondering at me, Dempster, I know you are, sir,&rdquo; Said Pete,
      &ldquo;'Deed, but I'm wondering at myself as well. I thought I was never going
      to see a glad day again, and if the sky would ever be blue I would be
      breaking my heart. But what is the Manx poet saying, sir? 'I have no will
      but Thine, O God.' That's me, sir, truth enough, and since the lil one has
      been mending I've never been so happy in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip muttered some commonplace, and put his thumb into the baby's hand.
      It was sucked in by the little fingers as by the soft feelers of the
      sea-anemone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete drew up the third chair, and then all interest was centred on the
      child. &ldquo;She's growing,&rdquo; said Philip huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And getting wise ter'ble,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;You wouldn't be-lave it, sir, but
      that child's got the head of an almanac. She has, though. Listen here, sir&mdash;what
      does the cow say, darling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moo-o,&rdquo; said the little one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that now!&rdquo; said Pete rapturously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows what the dog says too,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;What does Dempster say,
      bogh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bow-wow,&rdquo; said the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me soul!&rdquo; said Pete, turning to Philip with amazement at the
      child's supernatural wisdom. &ldquo;And there's Tom Hommy's boy&mdash;and a fine
      lil fellow enough for all&mdash;but six weeks older than this one, and not
      a word out of him yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing himself talked of, the dog had come from under the table. The
      child gurgled down at it, then made purring noises at its own feet, and
      wriggled in Nancy's lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear heart alive, if it's not like nursing an eel,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;Be
      quiet, will you?&rdquo; and the little one was shaken back to her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aisy all, woman,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;She's just wanting her lil shoes and
      stockings off, that's it.&rdquo; Then talking to the child. &ldquo;Um&mdash;am-im&mdash;lum&mdash;la&mdash;loo?
      Just so! I don't know what that means myself, but she does, you see. Aw,
      the child is taiching me heaps, sir. Listening to the lil one I'm
      remembering things. Well, we're only big children, the best of us. That's
      the way the world's keeping young, and God help it when we're getting so
      clever there's no child left in us at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time for young women to be in bed, though,&rdquo; said Nancy, getting up to
      give the baby her bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me have a hould of the rogue first,&rdquo; said Pete, and as Nancy took the
      child out of the room, he dragged at it and smothered its open mouth with
      kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor sport for you, sir, watching a foolish ould father playing games
      with his lil one,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip's answer was broken and confused. His eyes had begun to fill, and
      to hide them he turned his head aside. Thinking he was looking at the
      empty places about the walls, Pete began to enlarge on his prosperity, and
      to talk as if he were driving all the trade of the island before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful fishing now, Phil. I'm exporting a power of cod. Gretting
      postal orders and stamps, and I don't know what. Seven-and-sixpence in a
      single post from Liverpool&mdash;that's nothing, sir, nothing at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy brought back the child, whose silvery curls were now damp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! a young lady coming in her night-dress!&rdquo; cried Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work enough! had to get it over her head, too,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;She
      wouldn't, no, she wouldn't. Here, take and dry her hair by the fire while
      I warm up her supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete rolled the sleeves of his jersey above his elbows, took the child on
      his knee, and rubbed her hair between his hands, singing&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Come, Bridget, Saint Bridget, come in at my door.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Nancy clattered about in her clogs, filled a saucepan with bread and milk,
      and brought it to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to me, Nancy,&rdquo; said Philip, and he leaned over and held the
      saucepan above the bar. The child watched him intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, did you ever?&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;The strange she's making of you, Philip?
      Don't you know the gentleman, darling? Aw, but he's knowing you, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The saucepan boiled, and Philip handed it back to Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to him then&mdash;away with you,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Gro to your godfather.
      He'd have been your name-father too if it had been a boy you'd been. Off
      you go!&rdquo; and he stretched out his hairy arms until the child touched the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip stooped to take the little one, who first pranced and beat the
      rushes with its feet as with two drumsticks, then trod on its own legs,
      swirled about to Pete's arms, dropped its lower lip, and set up a
      terrified outcry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! she knows her own father, bless her,&rdquo; cried Pete, plucking the child
      back to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip dropped his head and laughed. A sort of creeping fear had taken
      possession of him, as if he felt remotely that the child was to be the
      channel of his retribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you feed her yourself, Pete?&rdquo; said Nancy. She was coming up with a
      saucer, of which she was tasting the contents. &ldquo;He's that handy with a
      child, sir, you wouldn't think 'Deed you wouldn't.&rdquo; Then, stooping to the
      baby as it ate its supper, &ldquo;But I'm saying, young woman, is there no sleep
      in your eyes to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but nodding away here like a wood-thrush in a tree,&rdquo; said Pete. He
      was ladling the pobs into the child's mouth, and scooping the overflow
      from her chin. &ldquo;Sleep's a terrible enemy of this one, sir. She's having a
      battle with it every night of life, anyway. God help her, she'll have luck
      better than some of us, or she'll be fighting it the other way about one
      of these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's us'ally going off with the spoon in her mouth, sir, for all the
      world like a lil cherub,&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too busy looking at her godfather to-night, though,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Well,
      look at him. You owe him your life, you lil sandpiper. And, my sakes, the
      straight like him you are, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't she?&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;If I wasn't thinking the same myself! Couldn't
      look straighter like him if she'd been his born child; now, could she? And
      the curls, too, and the eyes! Well, well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she'd been a boy, now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Philip had risen to return to the Court-house, and Pete said in
      another tone, &ldquo;Hould hard a minute, sir&mdash;I've something to show you.
      Here, take the lil one, Nancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete lit a candle and led the way into the parlour. The room was empty of
      furniture; but at one end there was a stool, a stone mason's mallet, a few
      chisels, and a large stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stone was a gravestone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete approached it solemnly, held up the candle in front of it, and said
      in a low voice, &ldquo;It's for her. I've been doing it myself, sir, and it's
      lasted me all winter, dark nights and bad days. I'll be finishing it
      to-night, though, God willing, and to-morrow, maybe, I'll be taking it to
      Douglas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Philip, but he could not finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stone was a plain slab, rounded at the top, bevelled about the edge,
      smoothed on the face, and chiselled over the back; but there was no sign
      or symbol on it, and no lettering or inscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there to be no name?&rdquo; asked Philip at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell you the truth, sir, I've been reading what it's saying in the ould
      Book about the Recording Angel calling the dead out of their graves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I've been thinking the way he'll be doing it will be going to the
      graveyards and seeing the names on the gravestones, and calling them out
      loud to rise up to judgment; some, as it's saying, to life eternal, and
      some to everlasting punishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I've been thinking if he comes to this one and sees no name on
      it&rdquo;&mdash;Pete's voice sank to a whisper&mdash;&ldquo;maybe he'll pass it by and
      let the poor sinner sleep on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stumbling back to the Court-house through the dark lane Philip thought,
      &ldquo;It was a lie <i>then</i>, but it's true <i>now</i>. It <i>must</i> be
      true. She must be dead.&rdquo; There was a sort of relief in this certainty. It
      was an end, at all events; a pitiful end, a cowardly end, a kind of
      sneaking out of Fate's fingers; it was not what he had looked for and
      intended, but he struggled to reconcile himself to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he remembered the child and thought, &ldquo;Why should I disturb it? Why
      should I disturb Pete? I will watch over it all its life. I will protect
      it and find a way to provide for it. I will do my duty by it. The child
      shall never want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was offering the key to the lock of the prisoners' yard when some one
      passed him in the lane, peered into his face, then turned about and spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's you, Deemster Christian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, doctor. Good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard the news from Ballawhaine? The old gentleman had another
      stroke this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I had not heard it. Another? Dear me, dear me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Back in his room, Philip resumed his wig and gown and returned to the
      Court-house. The place was now lit up by candlelight and densely crowded.
      Everybody rose to his feet as the Deemster stepped to the dais.

    <h2>
      V.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Come, Bridget, Saint Bridget, come in at my door,
     The crock's on the bink and the rush&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's fast,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;Rocking this one to sleep is like waiting for
      the kettle to boil. You may try and try, and blow and blow, but never a
      sound. And no sooner have you forgotten all about her, but she's singing
      away as steady as a top.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy put the child into the cradle, tucked her about, twisted the head of
      the little nest so that the warmth of the fire should enter it, and hung a
      shawl over the hood to protect the little eyelids from the light. &ldquo;Will
      you keep the house till I'm home from Sulby, Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've my work, woman,&rdquo; said Pete from the parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll put a junk on the fire and be off then,&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pulled the door on to the catch behind her and went crunching the
      gravel to the gate. There was no sound in the house now but the gentle
      breathing of the sleeping child, soft as an angel's prayer, the chirruping
      of the mended fire like a cage of birds, the ticking of the clock, and,
      through the parlour wall, the dull pat-put, pat-put of the wooden mallet
      and the scrape of the chisel on the stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete worked steadily for half an hour, and then came back to the
      hall-kitchen with his tools in his hands. The cob of coal had kindled to a
      lively flame, which flashed and went out, and the quick black shadows of
      the chairs and the table and the jugs on the dresser were leaping about
      the room like elves. With parted lips, just breaking into a smile, Pete
      went down on one knee by the cradle, put the mallet under his arm, and
      gently raised the shawl curtain. &ldquo;God bless my motherless girl,&rdquo; he said,
      in a voice no louder than a breath. Suddenly, while he knelt there, he was
      smitten as by an electric shock. His face straightened and he drew back,
      still holding the shawl at the tips of his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child was sleeping peacefully, with one of its little arms over the
      counterpane. On its face the flickering light of the fire was coming and
      going, making lines about the baby eyes and throwing up the baby features.
      It is in such lights that we are startled by resemblances in a child's
      face. Pete was startled by a resemblance. He had seen it before, but not
      as he saw it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment afterwards he was reaching across the cradle again, his arms
      spread over it, and his face close down at the child's face, scanning
      every line of it as one scans a map. &ldquo;'Deed, but she is, though,&rdquo; he
      murmured. &ldquo;She's like him enough, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An awful idea had taken possession of his mind. He rose stiffly to his
      feet, and the shawl flapped back. The room seemed to be darkening round
      him. He broke the coal, though it was burning brightly, stepped to the
      other side of the cradle, and looked at the child again. It was the same
      from there. The resemblance was ghostly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt something growing hard inside of him, and he returned to his work
      in the parlour. But the chisel slipped, the mallet fell too heavily, and
      he stopped. His mind fluctuated among distant things. He could not help
      thinking of Port Mooar, of the Carasdhoo men, of the day when he and
      Philip were brought home in the early, morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting his tools down, he returned to the room. He was holding his breath
      and walking softly, as if in the presence of an invisible thing. The room
      was perfectly quiet&mdash;he could hear the breath in his nostrils. In a
      state of stupor he stood for some time with bis back to the fire and
      watched his shadow on the opposite wall and on the ceiling. The cradle was
      at his feet. He could not keep his eyes off it. From time to time he
      looked down across one of his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      With head thrown back and lips apart, the child was breathing calmly and
      sleeping the innocent sleep. This angel innocence reproached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heart must be going bad,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Your bad thoughts are
      blackening the dead. For shame, Pete Quilliam, for shame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was feeling like a man who is in a storm of thunder and lightning at
      night. Familiar things about him looked strange and awful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stooping to the cradle again, he turned back the shawl on to the
      cradle-head as a girl turns back the shade of her sun-bonnet Then the
      firelight was full on the child's face, and it moved in its sleep. It
      moved yet more under his steadfast gaze, and cried a little, as if the
      terrible thought that was in his mind had penetrated to its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was stooping so when the door was opened and Cæsar entered violently,
      making asthmatic noises in his throat. Pete looked up at him with a
      stupefied air. &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you sell that mortgage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete answered with a growl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you transfer it to me?&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time's not come,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time foretold by the prophet, when the lion can lie down with the
      lamb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete laughed bitterly. Cæsar was quivering, his mouth was twitching, and
      his eyes were wild. &ldquo;Will you come over to the 'Mitre,' then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for to the 'Mitre'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ross Christian is there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete made an impatient gesture. &ldquo;That stormy petrel again! He's always
      about when there's bad weather going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come and hear what the man's saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's he saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you hear for yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete looked hard at Cæsar, looked again, then caught up his cap and went
      out at the door.

    <h2>
      VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      With two of his cronies the man had spent the day in a room overlooking
      the harbour, drinking hard and playing billiards. Early in the afternoon a
      messenger had come from Ballawhaine, saying, &ldquo;Your father is ill&mdash;come
      home immediately.&rdquo; &ldquo;By-and-bye,&rdquo; he had said, and gone on with the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the afternoon the messenger had come again, saying, &ldquo;Your father
      has had a stroke of paralysis, and he is calling for you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Let me finish
      the break first,&rdquo; he had replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening the messenger had come a third time, saying, &ldquo;Your father
      is unconscious.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where's the hurry, then?&rdquo; he had answered, and he sang a
      stave of the &ldquo;Miller's Daughter&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;They married me against my will,
     When I was daughter at the mill.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Finally, Cæsar, who had been remonstrating with the Ballawhaine at the
      moment of his attack, came to remonstrate with Ross, and to pay off a
      score of his own as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; cried
      Cæsar, with uplifted arm and the high pitch of the preacher. &ldquo;But your
      days will not be long, anyway, and, if you are the death of that foolish
      ould man, it won't be the first death you're answerable for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you believe it, too?&rdquo; said Ross, cue in hand. &ldquo;You believe your
      daughter is dead, do you, old Jephthah Jeremiah? Would you be surprised to
      hear, now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (the cronies giggled) &ldquo;that she isn't dead at
      all?&mdash;&mdash;Good shotr-cannon off the cushion. Halloa! Jephthah
      Jeremiah has seen a ghost seemingly. Saw her myself, man, when I was up in
      town a month ago. Want to know where she is? Shall I tell you? Oh, you're
      a beauty! You're a pattern! You know how to train up a child in the way&mdash;&mdash;Pocket
      off the red&mdash;&mdash;It's you to preach at my father, isn't it? She's
      on the streets of London&mdash;ah, Jeremiah's gone&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'They married me against my will '&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      There you are, then&mdash;good shot&mdash;love&mdash;twenty-five and
      nothing left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete pushed through to the billiard-room. Fearing there might be violence,
      hoping there would be, yet thinking it scarcely proper to lend the scene
      of it the light of his countenance, Cæsar had stayed outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloa! here's Uriah!&rdquo; cried Ross. &ldquo;Talk of the devil&mdash;just thought
      as much. Ever read the story of David and Uriah? Should, though. Do you
      good, mister. David was a great man. Aw&rdquo; (with a mock imitation of Pete's
      Manx), &ldquo;a ter'ble, wonderful, shocking great man. Uriah was his henchman.
      Ter'ble clavar, too, but that green for all, the ould cow might have ate
      him. And Uriah had a nice lil wife. The nice now, you wouldn't think. But
      when Uriah was away David took her, and then&mdash;and then&rdquo; (dropping the
      Manx) &ldquo;it doesn't just run on Bible lines neither, but David told Uriah
      that his wife was dead&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'Who saw her diet
     I said the fly,
     I saw her&mdash;&mdash;'
</pre>
    <p>
      Stop that&mdash;let go&mdash;help&mdash;&mdash;You'll choke me&mdash;help!
      help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At two strides Pete had come face to face with Ross, put one of his hands
      at the man's throat and his leg behind him, doubled him back on his knee,
      and was holding him there in a grip like that of a vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help!&mdash;help!&mdash;oo&mdash;ugh!&rdquo; The fellow gasped, and his face
      grew dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not worth it,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;I meant to choke the life out of your
      dirty body for lying about the living and blackening the dead, but you're
      not worth hanging for. You've got the same blood in you, too, and I'm
      ashamed for you. There! get up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a gesture of indescribable loathing, Pete flung the man to the
      ground, and he fell over his cue and broke it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people of the house came thronging into the room, and met Pete going
      out of it. His face was hard and ugly. At first sight they mistook him for
      Ross, so disfigured was he by bad passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar was tramping the pavement outside. &ldquo;Will you let me do it now?&rdquo; he
      said in a hot whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do as you like,&rdquo; said Pete savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wicked is snared in the work of his own hand. Higgaion. Selah,&rdquo; said
      Cæsar, and they parted by the entrance to the Court-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete went home, muttering to himself, &ldquo;The man was lying&mdash;she's dead,
      she's dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the gate of Elm Cottage the dog came up to him, barking with glee. Then
      it darted back to the house door, which stood open. &ldquo;Some one has come,&rdquo;
       thought Pete. &ldquo;She's dead. The man lied. She's dead,&rdquo; he muttered, and he
      stumbled down the path.

    <h2>
      VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While the Deemster was stepping up to the dais, and the people in the
      court were rising to receive him, a poor bedraggled wayfarer was toiling
      through the country towards the town. It was a woman. She must have walked
      far, her step was so slow and so heavy. From time to time she rested, not
      sitting, but standing by the gates of the fields as she came to them, and
      holding by the topmost bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she emerged from the dark lanes into the lamplit streets her pace
      quickened for a moment; then it slackened, and then it quickened again.
      She walked close to the houses, as if trying to escape observation. Where
      there was a short cut through an ill-lighted thoroughfare, she took it.
      Any one following her would have seen that she was familiar with every
      corner of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be hard to imagine a woman of more miserable appearance. Not that
      her clothes were so mean, though they were poor and worn, but that an air
      of humiliation sat upon her, such as a dog has when it is lost and the
      children are chasing it. Her dress was that of an old woman&mdash;the long
      Manx cloak of blue homespun, fastened by a great hook close under the
      chin, and having a hood which is drawn over the head. But in spite of this
      old-fashioned garment, and the uncertainty of her step, she gave the
      impression of a young woman. Where the white frill of the old
      countrywoman's cap should have shown itself under the flange of the hood,
      there was a veil, which seemed to be suspended from a hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oddity and incongruity of her attire attracted attention. Women came
      out of their houses and crossed to the doors of neighbours to look after
      her. Even the boys playing at the corners looked up as she went by.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not greatly observed for all that. An unusual interest agitated
      the town. A wave of commotion flowed down the streets. The traffic went in
      one direction. That direction was the Court-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Court-house square was thronged on three of its sides by people who
      were gathered both on the pavement and on the green inside the railings.
      Its fourth side was the dark lane at the back going by the door to the
      prisoners' yard and the Deemster's entrance. The windows were lit up and
      partly open. Some of the people had edged to the walls as if to listen,
      and a few had clambered to the sills as if to see. Around the wide doorway
      there was a close crowd that seemed to cling to it like a burr.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman had reached the first angle of the square when the upper half of
      the Court-house door broke into light over the heads of the crowd. A man
      had come out. He surged through the crowd and &ldquo;came down to the gate with
      a tail of people trailing after him and asking questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;The Dempster's spaking. Aw, a Daniel come to
      judgment, sir. Pity for Tom, though&mdash;the man'll get time. I'm sorry
      for an ould friend&mdash;but the Lord's will be done! Let not the ties of
      affection be a snare to our feet&mdash;it'll be five years if it's a day,
      and (D.V.) he'll never live to see the end of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Cæsar. He crossed the street to the &ldquo;Mitre.&rdquo; The woman trembled and
      turned towards the lane at the back. She walked quicker than ever now.
      But, stumbling over the irregular cobbles of the paved way, she stopped
      suddenly at the sound of a voice. By this time she was at the door to the
      prisoners' yard, and it was standing open. The door of the corridor
      leading by the Deemster's chamber to the Court-house was also ajar, as if
      it had been opened to relieve the heat of the crowded room within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be just and fear not,&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;Remember, whatever unconscious
      misrepresentations have been made this day, whatever deliberate
      false-swearing (and God and the consciences of the guilty ones know well
      there have been both), truth is mighty, and in the end it will prevail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor bedraggled wayfarer stood in the darkness and trembled. Her hands
      clutched at the breast of the cloak, her head dropped into her breast, and
      a half-smothered moan escaped from her. She knew the voice; it had once
      been very sweet and dear to her; she had heard it at her ear in tones of
      love. It was the voice of the Deemster. He was speaking from the judge's
      seat; the people were hanging on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was standing in the shadow of the dark lane under the prisoners'
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman was Kate. It was true that she had been to London; it was false
      that she had lived a life of shame there. In six months she had descended
      to the depths of poverty and privations. One day she had encountered Ross.
      He was fresh from the Isle of Man, and he told her of the child's illness.
      The same night she turned her face towards home. It was three weeks since
      she had returned to the island, and she was then low in health, in heart,
      and in pocket. The snow was falling. It was a bitter night. Growing dizzy
      with the drifting whiteness and numb with the piercing cold, she had crept
      up to a lonely house and asked shelter until the storm should cease.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was the home of three old people, two old brothers and an old
      sister, who had always lived together. In this household Kate had spent
      three weeks of sickness, and the Manx cloak on her back was a parting gift
      which the old woman had hung over her thinly-clad shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in the roads Kate had time to tell herself how foolish was her
      journey. She was like a sailor who has alarming news of home in some
      foreign port and hears nothing afterwards until he comes to harbour. À
      month had passed. So many things might have happened. The child might be
      better; it might be dead and buried. Nevertheless she pushed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she left London she had been full of bitterness towards Philip. It
      was his fault that she had ever been parted from her baby. She would go
      back. If she brought shame upon him, let him bear it. On coming near to
      home this feeling of vengeance died. Nothing was left but a great longing
      to be with her little one and a sense of her own degradation. Every face
      she recognised seemed to remind her of the change that had been wrought in
      herself since she had looked on it last. She dare not ask; she dare not
      speak; she dare not reveal herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she stood in the shadow of the prisoners' yard listening to Philip's
      voice, and held by it as by a spell, there was a low hiss and then a sort
      of white silence, as when a rocket breaks in the air. The Deemster had
      finished; the people in the court were breathing audibly and moving in
      their seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute later she was standing by her old home, hers no longer, and
      haunted in her mind by many bitter memories. It was dark and cheerless. A
      candle had been burning in the parlour, but it was now spluttering in the
      fat at the socket. As she looked into the room, it blinked and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last mile of her journey she had made up her mind what she
      would do. She would creep up to the house and listen for the sound of a
      child's voice. If she heard it, and the voice was that of a child that was
      well, she would be content, she would go away. And if she did not hear it,
      if the child was gone, if there was no longer any child there, if it was
      in heaven, she would go away just the same&mdash;only God knew how, God
      knew where.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road was quiet. With trembling fingers she raised the latch of the
      gate, and stepped two paces into the garden. There was no sound from
      within. She took two steps more and listened intently. Nothing was
      audible. Her heart fell yet lower. She told herself that when a child
      lived in a house the very air breathed of its presence, and its little
      voice was everywhere. Then she remembered that it was late, that it was
      night, that even if the child were well it would now be bathed and in bed.
      &ldquo;How foolish!&rdquo; she thought, and she took a few steps more.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had meant to reach the hall window and look in, butt before she could
      do so, something came scudding along the path in her direction. It was the
      dog, and he was barking furiously. All at once he stopped and began to
      caper about her. Then he broke into barking again, this time with a note
      of recognition and delight, shot into the house and came back, still
      barking, and making a circle of joyful salutation in the darkness round
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quaking with fear of instant discovery, she crept under the old tree and
      waited. Nobody came from the house. &ldquo;There's no one at home,&rdquo; she told
      herself, and at that thought the certainty that the child was gone fell on
      her as an oppression of distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless she stepped up to the porch and listened again. There was no
      sound within except the ticking of the clock. Making a call on her
      courage, she pushed the door open with the tips of her fingers. It made a
      rustle as the bottom brushed over the rushes. At that she uttered a faint
      cry and crept back trembling. But all was silence again in an instant. The
      fire gave out a strong red glow which spread over the walls and the
      ceiling. Her mind took in the impression that the place was almost empty,
      but she had no time for such observations. With slow and stiff motions she
      slid into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she heard a sleepy whimper and it thrilled her. In an instant she had
      seen the thing she looked for&mdash;the cradle, with its hood towards the
      door and its foot to the fire. At the next moment she was on her knees
      beside it, doubled over it and crying softly to the baby, looking so
      different, smelling of milk and of sleep, &ldquo;My darling! my darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the moment when Pete was coming up the path. The dog was frisking
      and barking about him. &ldquo;She's dead,&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;The man lied. She's
      dead.&rdquo; With that word on his lips he heaved heavily into the house. As he
      did so he became aware that some one was there already. Before his eye had
      carried the news to his brain, his ear had told him. He heard a voice
      which he knew well, though it seemed to be a memory of no waking moment,
      but to come out of the darkness and the hours of sleep. It was a soft and
      mellow voice, saying, &ldquo;My beautiful darling! My beautiful, rosy darling I
      My darling! My darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw a woman kneeling by the cradle, with both arms buried in it as
      though they encircled the sleeping child. Her hood was thrown back, and
      her head was bare. The firelight fell on her face, and he knew it. He
      passed his hand across his eyes as if trying to wipe out the apparition,
      but it remained. He tried to speak, but his tongue was stiff. He stood
      motionless and stared. He could not remove his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate heard the door thrown open, and she lifted her head in terror. Pete
      was before her, with a violent expression on his face. The expression
      changed, and he looked at her as if she had been a spirit. Then, in a
      voice of awe, he said, &ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know me?&rdquo; she answered timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as if he did not hear. &ldquo;Then it's true,&rdquo; he muttered to himself;
      &ldquo;the man did not lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt her knees trembling under her. &ldquo;I haven't come to stay,&rdquo; she
      faltered. &ldquo;They told me the child was ill, and I couldn't help coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still he did not speak to her. As he looked, his face grew awful. The dew
      of fear broke out on her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know me, Pete?&rdquo; she said in a helpless way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he stood looking down at her, fixedly, almost threateningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Katherine,&rdquo; she said, with a downcast look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Katherine is dead,&rdquo; he answered vacantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is in her grave,&rdquo; he said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that she were in her grave indeed!&rdquo; said Kate, and she covered her
      face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is dead and buried, and gone from this house for ever,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not intend to cast her off; he was only muttering vague words in
      the first spasm of his pain; but she mistook them for commands to her to
      go.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's silence, and then she uncovered her face and said, &ldquo;I
      understand&mdash;yes, I will go away. I oughtn't to have come back at all&mdash;I
      know that. But I will go now. I won't trouble you any more. I will never
      come again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kissed the child passionately. It rubbed its little face with the back
      of its hand, but it did not awake. She pulled the hood on to her head, and
      drew the veil over her face. Then she lifted herself feebly to her feet,
      stood a moment looking about her, made a faint pathetic cry and slid out
      at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was gone, Pete, without uttering a word or a sound, stumbled into
      a chair before the fire, put one hand on the cradle, and fell to rocking
      it. After some time he looked over his shoulder, like a man who was coming
      out of unconsciousness, and said, &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soul has room for only one great emotion at once, and he had begun to
      say to himself, &ldquo;She's alive! She's here!&rdquo; The air of the house seemed to
      be soft with her presence. Hush!
    </p>
    <p>
      He got on to his feet. &ldquo;Kate!&rdquo; he called softly, very softly, as if she
      were near and had only just crossed the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate!&rdquo; he called again more loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went out at the porch and floundered along the path, crying again
      and again, in a voice of boundless emotion, &ldquo;Kate! Kate! Kate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Kate did not hear him. He was tugging at the gate to open it, when
      something seemed to give way inside his head, and a hoarse groan came from
      his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's better dead,&rdquo; he thought, and then reeled back to the house like a
      drunken man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire looked black, as if it had gone out. He sat down in the darkness,
      and put his hand into his teeth to keep himself from crying out.

    <h2>
      VIII..
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The Deemster in the half-lit Court-house was passing sentence.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prisoner,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have been found guilty by a jury of your
      countrymen of one of the cruellest of the crimes of imposture. You have
      deceived the ignorant, betrayed the unwary, lied to the simple, and robbed
      the poor. You have built your life upon a lie, and in your old age it
      brings you to confusion. In ruder times than ours your offence would have
      worn another complexion; it would have been called witchcraft, not
      imposture, and your doom would have been death. The sentence of the court
      is that you be committed to the Castle Rushen for the term of one year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Black Tom, who had stood during the Deemster's sentence with his bald head
      bent, wiping his eyes on his sleeve and leaving marks on his face,
      recovered his self-conceit as he was being hustled out of court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right, Dempster,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Witchcraft isn't worth nothing now.
      Religion's the only roguery that's going these days. Your friend Cæsar was
      wise, sir. Bes' re-spec's to him, Dempster, and may you live up to your
      own tex' yourself, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my industry and integrity,&rdquo; said a solemn voice at the door&mdash;&ldquo;and
      what's it saying in Scripture?&mdash;'If any provide not for his own house
      he is worse than an infidel.' But the Lord is my shield. What for should I
      defend myself? I am a worm and no man, saith the Psalms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Psalms is about right then, Cæsar,&rdquo; shouted Black Tom from between
      two constables.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the commotion that followed on the prisoner's noisy removal, the Clerk
      of the Court was heard to speak to the Deemster. There was another case
      just come in&mdash;attempted suicide&mdash;woman tried to fling herself
      into the harbour&mdash;been prevented&mdash;would his Honour take it now,
      or let it stand over for the High Bailiff's court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll take it now,&rdquo; said the Deemster. &ldquo;We may dismiss her in a moment,
      poor creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman was brought in. She was less like a human creature than like a
      heap of half-drenched clothes. A cloak which looked black with the water
      that soaked it at the hood covered her body and head. Her face seemed to
      be black also, for a veil which she wore was wet, and clung to her
      features like a glove. Some of the people in court recognised her figure
      even in the uncertain candlelight. She was the woman who had been seen to
      come into the town during the hour of the court's adjournment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half helped, half dragged by constables, she entered the prisoner's dock.
      There she clutched the bar before her as if to keep herself from falling.
      Her head was bent down between her shrinking shoulders as if she were
      going through the agony of shame and degradation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman shouldn't have been brought here like this&mdash;quick, be
      quick,&rdquo; said the Deemster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evidence was brief. One of the constables being on duty in the
      market-place had heard screams from the quay. On reaching the place, he
      had found the harbour-master carrying a woman up the quay steps. Mr.
      Quarry, coming out of the harbour office, had seen a woman go by like the
      wind. A moment afterwards he had heard a cry, and had run to the second
      steps. The woman had been caught by a boathook in attempting to get into
      the water. She was struggling to drown herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Deemster watched the prisoner intently. &ldquo;Is anything known about her?&rdquo;
       he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk answered that she appeared to be a stranger, but she would give
      no information. Then the sergeant of police stepped up to the dock. In
      emphatic tones the big little person asked the woman various questions.
      What was her name? No answer. Where did she come from? No answer. What was
      she doing in Ramsey? Still no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Honour,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;doubtless this is one of the human
      wrecks that come drifting to our shores in the summer season. The poorest
      of them are often unable to get away when the season is over, and so
      wander over the island, a pest and a burden to every place they set foot
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning back to the figure crouching in the dock, he said, &ldquo;Woman,
      are you a street-walker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman gave a piteous cry, let go her hold of the bar, sank back to the
      seat behind her, brushed up the wet black veil, and covered her face with
      her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down this instant, Mr. Gawne,&rdquo; said the Deemster hotly, and there was
      a murmur of approval from behind. &ldquo;We must not keep this woman a moment
      longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose, leaned across to the rail in front, clasped his hands before him,
      looked down at the woman in the dock, and said in a low tone, that would
      have been barely loud enough to reach her ears but for the silence, as of
      a tomb, in the court, &ldquo;My poor woman, is there anybody who can answer for
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner stooped her head lower and began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a woman is so unhappy as to try to take her life, it sometimes
      occurs, only too sadly, that another is partly to blame for the condition
      that tempts her to the crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Deemster's voice was as soft as a caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is such a one in this case, we ought to learn it. He ought to
      stand by your side. It is only right; it is only just. Is there anybody
      here who knows you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner was now crying piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! we mean no harm to any one. It is in the nature of woman, however low
      she may sink, however deep her misfortunes, to shield her dearest enemy.
      That is the brave impulse of the weakest among women, and all good men
      respect it. But the law has its duty, and in this instance it is one of
      mercy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman moaned audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be afraid, my poor girl. Nobody shall harm you here. Take courage
      and look around. Is there anybody in court who can speak for you&mdash;who
      can tell us how you came to the place where you are now standing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman let fall her hands, raised her head, and looked up at the
      Deemster, face to face and eye to eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there is <i>one</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Deemster's countenance became pale, his eyes glistened, his look
      wandered, his lips trembled&mdash;he was biting them, they were bleeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remove her in custody,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;let her be well cared for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a tumult in a moment. Everybody had recognised the prisoner as
      she was being taken out, though shame and privation had so altered her.
      &ldquo;Peter Quilliam's wife!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Cæsar Cregeen's daughter&mdash;where's the
      man himself?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Then it's truth they're telling&mdash;it's not dead
      she is at all, but worse.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Lor-a-massy!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What a trouble for
      the Dempster!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Kate was gone, the court ought to have adjourned instantly, yet the
      Deemster remained in his seat. There was a mist before his eyes which
      dazzled him. He had a look at once wild and timid. His limbs pained
      although they were swelling to enormous size. He felt as if a heavy,
      invisible hand had been laid on the top of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk caught his eye, and then he rose with an apologetic air, took
      hold of the rail, and made an effort to cross the dais. At the next moment
      his servant, Jem-y-Lord, had leapt up to his side, but he made an
      impatient gesture as if declining help.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three steps going down to the floor of the court, and a handrail
      on one side of them. Coming to these steps, he stumbled, muttered some
      confused words, and fell forward on to his face. The people were on their
      feet by this time, and there was a rush to the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand back! He has only fainted,&rdquo; cried Jem-y-Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse than that,&rdquo; said the sergeant. &ldquo;Get him to bed, and send for Dr.
      Mylechreest instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can we take him?&rdquo; said somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They keep a room for him at Elm Cottage,&rdquo; said somebody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not there,&rdquo; said Jem-y-Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's nearest, and there's no time to lose,&rdquo; said the sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they lifted Philip, and carried him as he lay, in his wig and gown as
      Deemster, to the house of Pete.

    <h2>
      IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is a kind of mental shock which, like an earthquake under a prison,
      bursts open every cell and lets the inmates escape. After a time, Pete
      remembered that he was sitting in the dark, and he got up to light a
      candle. Looking for candlestick and matches, he went from table to
      dresser, from dresser to table, and from table back to dresser, doing the
      same thing over and over again, and not perceiving that he was going round
      and round. When at length the candle was lighted, he took it in his hand
      and went into the parlour like a sleepwalker. He set it on the
      mantelpiece, and sat down on the stool. In his blurred vision confused
      forms floated about him. &ldquo;Ah! my tools,&rdquo; he thought, and picked up the
      mallet and two of the chisels. He was sitting with these in his hands when
      his eyes fell on the other candlestick, the one in which the candle had
      gone out &ldquo;I meant to light a candle,&rdquo; he thought, and he got up and took
      the empty candlestick into the hall. When he came back with another
      lighted candle, he perceived that there were two. &ldquo;I'm going stupid,&rdquo; he
      thought, and he blew out the first one. A moment afterwards he forgot that
      he had done so, and seeing the second still burning, he blew that out
      also.
    </p>
    <p>
      So dull were his senses that he did not realise that anything was amiss.
      His eyes were seeing objects everywhere about&mdash;they were growing to
      awful size and threatening him. His ears were hearing noises&mdash;they
      were making a fearful tumult inside his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was not entirely dark. A shaft of bleared moonlight came and went
      at intervals. The moon was scudding through an angry sky, sometimes
      appearing, sometimes disappearing. Pete returned to the stool, and then he
      was in the light, but the nameless stone, leaning against the wall, was in
      the shade. He took up the mallet and chisels again, intending to work.
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he said as he began. The clamour in his brain was so loud that he
      thought some one was making a noise in the house. This task was sacred. He
      always worked at it in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pat-put! pat-put!</i> How long he worked he never knew. There are
      moments which are not to be measured as time. In the uncertain handling of
      the chisel and the irregular beat of the mallet something gave way. There
      was a harsh sound like a groan. A crack like a flash of forked lightning
      had shot across the face of the stone. He had split it in half. Its great
      pieces fell to the floor on either side of him. Then he remembered that
      the stone had been useless. &ldquo;It doesn't matter now,&rdquo; he thought. Nothing
      mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the mallet hanging from his hand he continued to sit in the drifting
      moonlight, feeling as if everything in the world had been shivered to
      atoms. His two idols had been scattered at one blow&mdash;his wife and his
      friend. The golden threads that had bound him to life were broken. When
      poverty had come, he had met it without repining; when death had seemed to
      come, he had borne up against it bravely. But wifeless, friendless,
      deceived where he had loved, betrayed where he had worshipped, he was
      bankrupt, he was broken, and a boundless despair took hold of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When hope is entirely gone, anguish will sometimes turn a man into a
      monster. There was a fretful cry from the cradle, and, still in the stupor
      of his despair, he went out to rock it. The fire, which had only slid and
      smouldered, was now struggling into flame, and the child looked up at him
      with Philip's eyes. A knife seemed to enter his heart at that moment. He
      was more desolate than he had thought. &ldquo;Hush, my child, hush!&rdquo; he said,
      without thinking. <i>His</i> child? He had none. That solace was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anger came to save his reason. Not to have felt anger, he must have been
      less than a man or more. He remembered what the child had been to him. He
      remembered what it was when it came, and again when he thought its mother
      was dead; he remembered what it was when death frowned on it, and what it
      had been since death passed it by. Flesh of his flesh, blood of his blood,
      bone of his bone, heart of his heart. Not his merely, but himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lie, a mockery, a delusion, a deception! <i>She</i> has practised it.
      Oh, she had hidden her secret. She had thought it was safe. But the child
      itself had betrayed it. The secret had spoken from the child's own face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I've seen her kneel by the cot and pray, 'God bless my baby, and its
      father and its mother'&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why had he not killed her? A wild vision rose before him of killing Kate,
      and then going to the Deemster and saying, &ldquo;Take me; I have murdered her
      because you have dishonoured her. Condemn me to death; yet remember God
      lives, and He will condemn you to damnation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the pity of it&mdash;the pity of it! By a quick revolt of tenderness
      he recalled Kate as he had just seen her, crouching at the back of the
      cradle, like a hunted hare with uplifted paws uttering its last pitiful
      cry. He remembered her altered face, so pale even in the firelight, so
      thin, so worn, and his anger began to smoke against Philip. The flower
      that he would have been proud to wear on his breast Philip had buried in
      the dark. Curse him! Curse him!
    </p>
    <p>
      She had given up all for that man&mdash;husband, child, father, mother,
      her friends, her good name, the very light of heaven. How she must have
      loved him! Yet he had been ashamed of her, had hidden her away, had been
      in fear lest the very air should whisper of her whereabouts. Curse him!
      Curse him! Curse him!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the heat of his great anger Pete thought of himself also. Jealousy was
      far beneath him, but, like all great souls, this simple man had known
      something of the grandeur of friendship. Two streams running into them and
      taking heaven into their bosom. But Philip had kept him apart, had banked
      him off, and yet drained him to the dregs. He had uncovered his nakedness&mdash;the
      nakedness of his soul itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bit by bit Pete pieced together the history of the past months. He
      remembered the night of Kate's disappearance, when he had gone to Ballure
      and shouted up at the lighted window, &ldquo;I've sent her to England,&rdquo; thinking
      to hide her fault. At that moment Philip had known all&mdash;where she was
      (for it was where he had sent her), why she was gone, and that she was
      gone for ever. Curse him! Curse him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete recalled the letters&mdash;the first one that he had put into
      Philip's hand, the second that he had read to him, the third that Philip
      had written to his dictation. The little forgeries' to keep her poor name
      sweet, the little inventions to make his story plausible, the little lies
      of love, the little jests of a breaking heart! And then the messages! The
      presents to the child! The reference to the Deemster himself! And the
      Deemster had sat there and seen through it all as the sun sees through
      glass, yet he had given no sign, he had never spoken; he had held a
      quivering, naked heart in his hand, while his own lay within as cold as a
      stone. Curse him, O God! Curse him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete remembered the night when Philip came to tell him that Kate was dead,
      and how he had comforted himself with the thought that he was not
      altogether alone in his great trouble, because his friend was with him. He
      remembered the journey to the grave, the grave itself&mdash;another's
      grave-how he knelt at the foot of it, and prayed aloud in Philip's
      hearing, &ldquo;Forgive me, my poor girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shall I kill him?&rdquo; thought Pete. Deemster too! First Deemster now,
      and held high in honour! Worshipped for his justice! Beloved for his
      mercy! O God! O God!
    </p>
    <p>
      There are passions so overmastering that they stifle speech, and man sinks
      back to the animal. With an inarticulate shout Pete went to the parlour
      and caught up the mallet. A frantic thought had flashed on him of killing
      Philip as he sat on the bench which he had disgraced, administering the
      law which he had outraged. The wild justice of this idea made the blood to
      bubble in his ears. He saw himself holding the Deemster by the throat, and
      crying aloud to the people, &ldquo;You think this man is a just judge&mdash;he
      is a whited sepulchre. You think he is as true as the sun&mdash;he is as
      false as the sea. He has robbed me of wife and child; at the very gates of
      heaven he has lied to me like hell. The hour of justice has struck, and
      thus I pay him&mdash;and thus&mdash;and thus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the power of words was lost in the drunkenness of his rage. With a
      dismal roar he flung the mallet away, and it rolled on the ground in
      narrowing circles. &ldquo;My hands, my hands,&rdquo; he thought. He would strangle
      Philip, and then he would kill everybody in his way, merely for the lust
      of killing. Why not? The fatal line was past. Nothing sacred remained. The
      world was a howling wilderness of boundless license. With the savage growl
      of a caged beast this wild man flung himself on the door, tore it open,
      and bounded on to the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he stopped suddenly. There was a thunderous noise outside, such as
      the waves make in a cave. A company of people were coming in at the gate.
      Some were walking with the heavy step of men who carry a corpse. Others
      were bearing lanterns, and a few held high over their heads the torches
      which fishermen use when they are hauling the white nets at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo; cried Pete, in a voice that was like a howl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend,&rdquo; said somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>My</i> friend? I have no friend,&rdquo; cried Pete, in a broken roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Deed he's gone, seemingly,&rdquo; said a voice out of the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete did not hear. Seeing the crowd and the lights, but only as darkness
      veined with fire, he thought Philip was coming again, as he had so often
      seen him come in his glory, in his greatness, in his triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;He's here,&rdquo; they answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Philip was brought up the path in the arms of four bearers, his
      head hanging aside and shaking at every step, his face white as the wig
      above it, and his gown trailing along the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden calm, and Pete dropped back in awe and horror. A bolt
      out of heaven seemed to have fallen at his feet, and he trembled as if
      lightning had blinded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      His anger had ebbed, his fury had dashed itself against a rock. His
      towering rage had shrunk to nothing in the face of this awful presence.
      The Dark Spirit had gone before him and snatched his victim out of his
      hands. He had come out to kill this man, and here he met him being brought
      home dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dead? Then his sin was dead also. God forgive him!
    </p>
    <p>
      God forgive him, where he was gone! Presumptuous man, stand back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, mighty and merciful Death! Death the liberator, the deliverer, the
      pardoner, the peace-maker! Even the shadow of thy face can quench the
      fires of revenge; even the gathering of thy wings can deaden the clamour
      of madness, and turn hatred into love and curses into prayers.

    <h2>
      X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In that stripped and naked house there was one room still untouched. It
      was the room that had been kept for the Deemster. Philip lay on the bed,
      motionless and apparently lifeless. Jem-y-Lord stood beating his hands at
      the foot. Pete sat on a low stool at the side with his face doubled on to
      his knees. Nancy, now back from Sulby, was blowing into the bars of the
      grate to kindle a fire. A little group of men stood huddled like sheep
      near the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one said the Deemster's heart was beating. They brought from another
      room a little ivory hand-glass and held it over the mouth. When they
      raised it the face of the mirror was faintly blurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      That little cloud on the glass seemed more bright than the shining tread
      of an angel on the sea. Jem-y-Lord took a sponge and began to moisten the
      cold forehead. One by one the people behind produced their old wife's
      wisdom. Somebody remembered that his grandmother always put salts to the
      nostrils of a person seemingly dead; somebody else remembered that when,
      on the very day of old Iron Christian's death, his father had been thrown
      by a colt and lay twelve hours unconscious, the farrier had bled him and
      he had opened his eyes instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor had been half an hour gone to Ballaugh, and a man had been put
      on a horse and sent after him. But it was a twelve-miles' journey; the
      night was dark; it would be a good hour before he could be back.
    </p>
    <p>
      They touched Pete on the shoulder and suggested something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; he answered vacantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dazed,&rdquo; they told themselves. The poor man could not give a wise-like
      answer. He had had a shock, and there was worse before him. They talked in
      low voices of Kate and of Ross Christian; they were sorry for Pete; they
      were still more sorry for the Deemster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Deemster's wig had been taken off and tossed on to the dressing-table.
      It lay mouth upwards like any old woman's night-cap. His hair had dragged
      after it on the pillow. The black gown had not been removed, but it was
      torn open at the neck so that the throat might be free. One of Philip's
      arms had dropped over the side of the bed, and the long, thin hand was
      cold and green and ethereal as marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete was crouching on his low stool beside this hand. He needed no
      softening to touch it now. The chill fingers were in his palm, and his hot
      tears were falling on them. Remembering the crime that he had so nearly
      committed, he was holding himself in horror. His friend! His life-long
      friend! His only friend! The Deemster no longer, but only the man. Not the
      man either, but the child. The cruel years had rolled back with all their
      burden of trouble. Forgotten days were come again&mdash;days long buried
      under the <i>débris</i> of memory. They were boys together again. A
      little, sunny fellow in velvet, and a bigger lad in a stocking-cap; the
      little one talking, always talking; the big one listening, always
      listening; the little one proposing, the big one agreeing; the little one
      leading, the big one following; the little one looking up and yet a little
      down, the big one looking down and yet a little up. Oh, the happy, happy
      times, before anger and jealousy and rage and the mad impulse of murder
      had darkened their sun shine!
    </p>
    <p>
      The memories that brought the tenderest throb to Pete as he sat there
      fingering the lifeless hand were of the great deeds that he had done for
      Philip&mdash;how he had fought for him, and been licked for him, and taken
      bloody noses for him, and got thrashed for it by Black Tom. But there were
      others only less tender. Philip was leaving home for King William's, and
      Pete was cudgelling his dull head what to give him for a parting gift.
      Decision was the more difficult because he had nothing to give. At length
      he had hit on making a whistle&mdash;the only thing his clumsy fingers had
      ever been deft at. With his clasp-knife he had cut a wondrous big one from
      the bough of a willow; he had pared it; he had turned it; it blew a blast
      like a fog-horn. The morning was frosty, and his feet were bare, but he
      didn't mind the cold; he didn't feel it&mdash;no, not a ha'p'orth. He was
      behind the hedge by the gate at Ballure, waiting for the coach that was to
      take up Philip, and passing the time by polishing the whistle on the leg
      of his shining breeches, and testing its tone with just one more blow.
      Then up came Crow, and out came Philip in his new peaked cap and leggings.
      Whoop! Gee-up! Away! Off they went without ever seeing him, without once
      looking back, and he was left in the prickly hedge with his blue feet on
      the frost, a look of dejection about his mouth, and the top of the foolish
      whistle peeping out of his jacket-pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thick sob that came of these memories was interrupted by a faint sound
      from the bed. It was a murmur of delirium, as soft as the hum of bees, yet
      Pete heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cover me up, Pete, cover me up!&rdquo; said Philip, dreaming aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was a living man! Thank God! Thank God!
    </p>
    <p>
      A whisper goes farther than a shout. The people behind whispered the news
      to the passage, the passage to the stairs, the stairs to the hall, and the
      hall to the garden, where a crowd had gathered in the darkness to look up
      at the house over which the angel of death was hovering.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the room was croaking like a frog-pond. &ldquo;Praise the Lord!&rdquo;
       cried one. &ldquo;His mercy endureth for ever,&rdquo; cried another. &ldquo;What's he
      saying?&rdquo; said a third. &ldquo;Rambling in his head, poor thing,&rdquo; said a fourth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete turned them out&mdash;all except Jem-y-Lord, who was still moistening
      the Deemster's face and opening his hands, which were now twitching and
      tightening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of this! Out you go!&rdquo; cried Pete hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use taking the anger with him&mdash;the man's tried,&rdquo; they muttered,
      and away they went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jemmy was loth to see them go. He was afraid to be left alone with Pete&mdash;afraid
      that the Deemster should be at the mercy of this wild creature with the
      flaming eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now that Philip was a living man Pete began to feel afraid of himself.
      At sight of life in Philip's face, his gnawing misery returned. He thought
      his hatred had been overcome, but he was wrestling in the throes of
      forgiveness again. Here was the man who had robbed him of wife and child
      and home! In another moment he might have held him in the grip of his just
      wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an inscrutable and awful fact, that just at that moment when a man's
      good angel has conquered, but is spent, his evil angel is sure to get the
      advantage of chance. Philip's delirium set in strong, and the brute beast
      in Pete, going through its final struggle, stood over the bed and watched
      him. In his violence Philip tore at his breast, and dragged something from
      beneath his shirt. A moment later it fell from his graspless fingers to
      the floor. It was a lock of dark hair. Pete knew whose hair it was, and he
      put his foot on it, and that instant the mad impulse came again to take
      Philip by the throat and choke him. Again and again it came. He had to
      tread it down even amid his sobs and his tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      But love cannot be killed in an instant. It does not drop down dead. There
      was a sort of tenderness in the thought that this was the man for whom
      Kate had given up all the world. Pete began to feel gently towards Philip
      because Kate loved him; he began to see something of Kate in Philip's
      face. This strange softening increased as he caught the words of Philip's
      delirium. He thought he ought to leave the room, but he could not tear
      himself away. Crouching down on the stool, he clasped his hands behind his
      head, and tightened his arms over his ears. It was useless. He could not
      help but listen. Only disjointed sentences, odd pages torn from the book
      of life, some of them blurred with tears; but they were like a cool hand
      on a fevered brow to him that heard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was a child, Philip&mdash;&mdash;didn't know what love was then&mdash;&mdash;coming
      home by Ramsey steamer&mdash;&mdash;tell the simple truth, Philip&mdash;&mdash;say
      we tried to be faithful and loyal and could not, because we loved each
      other, and there was no help for&mdash;&mdash;tell Kirry&mdash;&mdash;yes,
      Auntie, I have read father's letters&mdash;&mdash;that picture is cracked&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This in the voice of one who speaks in his sleep, and then in a hushed,
      hot whisper, &ldquo;Haven't I a right to you?&mdash;&mdash;yes, I have a right&mdash;&mdash;take
      your topcoat, then, the storm is coming&mdash;&mdash;I'll never let you go&mdash;&mdash;don't
      you remember?&mdash;&mdash;can you ever forget&mdash;&mdash;my husband!&mdash;&mdash;my
      husband!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete lifted his head as he listened. He had been thinking that Philip had
      robbed him of Kate. Was it he who had robbed Kate of Philip?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't live any longer in this house, Philip&mdash;&mdash;the walls are
      crushing me; the ceiling is falling on me; the air is stifling me&mdash;&mdash;three
      o'clock, Pete&mdash;&mdash;yes, three to-morrow, in the Council Chamber at
      Douglas&mdash;&mdash;I'm not a bad woman, Philip Christian&mdash;&mdash;there
      is something you have never guessed and I have never told you&mdash;&mdash;is
      it the child, Kate?&mdash;&mdash;did you say the child?&mdash;&mdash;you
      are sure&mdash;&mdash;you are not deceiving yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this in a tone of deep entreaty, and then, with quick-coming breath,
      &ldquo;Jemmy, get the carriage at Shimmin's and drive it yourself&mdash;&mdash;if
      there is any attempt at Ramsey to take the horse out&mdash;&mdash;drive to
      the lane between the chapel and the cottage&mdash;&mdash;the moment the
      lady joins you&mdash;&mdash;you are right, Kate&mdash;&mdash;you cannot
      live here any longer&mdash;&mdash;this life of deception must end&mdash;&mdash;that's
      the churring of the night-jar going up to Ballure Glen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jem-y-Lord, who was beating out the pillow, dropped it, in his fumbling,
      half over the Deemster's face, and looked at Pete in terror. Would this
      cruel delirium never break? Where was the doctor? Would he not come at
      all?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete had risen to his feet, and was gazing down with a look of stupor. He
      had been thinking that Philip had robbed him of the child. Was it he who
      had robbed Philip?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Pete is telling the same story. He is writing letters to himself&mdash;&mdash;such
      simple things!&mdash;&mdash;poor old Pete&mdash;&mdash;he means no harm&mdash;&mdash;he
      never dreams that every word is burning&mdash;&mdash;Jemmy, leave out more
      brandy to-night, the decanter is empty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete leaned over the pillow. All at once he started back. Philip's eyes
      were open and shining up at him. It was hard to believe that Philip was
      not speaking to him eye to eye. But there was a veil between them, the
      veil of the hand of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Philip, <i>I</i> know,&rdquo; said the unconscious man in a quick
      whisper; he was breathing fast and loud. &ldquo;Tell him I'm dead&mdash;&mdash;yes,
      yes, that's it, that's it&mdash;&mdash;cruel?&mdash;&mdash;no, but kind&mdash;&mdash;'Poor
      girl,' he'll say, 'I loved her once, but she's gone'&mdash;&mdash;I'll do
      it, I'll do it.&rdquo; Then, in tones of fear, &ldquo;It's madness&mdash;&mdash;to
      paint faces on the darkness, to hear voices in the air is madness.&rdquo; And
      then, solemnly, with a chill, thick utterance, &ldquo;There&mdash;&mdash;there&mdash;&mdash;that
      one by the wall&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big drops of sweat broke out on Pete's forehead. Had he been thinking that
      Philip had tortured him? It was he who had been torturing Philip. The
      letters, the messages, the presents, these had been the whips and
      scorpions in his hand. Every innocent word, every look, every sign, had
      been as thongs in the instrument of torture. Pete began to feel a great
      pity for Philip. &ldquo;He had suffered plenty,&rdquo; thought Pete. &ldquo;He has carried
      this cross about far enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, boatman!&mdash;&mdash;I went too far&mdash;&mdash;yes, I am
      back again, thank God&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words brightly, cheerily, hopefully; then, in the deepest tones,
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Philip&mdash;&mdash;it's all my fault&mdash;&mdash;I've broken
      the heart of one man, and I'm destroying the soul of another&mdash;&mdash;I'm
      leaving this lock of hair&mdash;it is all I have to leave&mdash;&mdash;good-bye!&mdash;&mdash;I
      ought to have gone long ago&mdash;&mdash;you will not hate me now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last words frayed off, broke in the throat, and stopped. Then quickly,
      with panting breath, came, &ldquo;Kate! Kate! Kate!&rdquo; again and again repeated,
      beginning in a loud beseeching cry and dying down to a long wail, as if
      shouted over a gloomy waste wherein the voice was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jem-y-Lord had been beating round towards the door, wringing his white
      hands like a woman, and praying to God that the Deemster might never come
      out of his unconsciousness. &ldquo;He has told him everything,&rdquo; thought Jem.
      &ldquo;The man will take his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came between them,&rdquo; thought Pete. &ldquo;She was not for me. She was not
      mine. She was Philip's. It was God's doings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bitterness of Pete's heart had passed away. &ldquo;But I wish&mdash;&mdash;what's
      the good of wishing, though? God help us all,&rdquo; he muttered, in a breaking
      voice, and then he crouched down on the stool as before and covered his
      face with his hands..
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip had lifted his head and risen on one elbow. He was looking out on
      the empty air with his glassy eyes, as if a picture stood up before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, no, yes&mdash;&mdash;don't tell me&mdash;&mdash;that Kate?&mdash;&mdash;it's
      a mistake&mdash;&mdash;that's not Kate&mdash;&mdash;that white face!&mdash;&mdash;those
      hollow eyes!&mdash;&mdash;that miserable woman!&mdash;&mdash;besides, Kate
      is dead&mdash;&mdash;she must be dead&mdash;&mdash;what's to do with the
      lamps?&mdash;&mdash;they are going out&mdash;&mdash;in the dock, too, and
      before me&mdash;&mdash;she there and I here!&mdash;&mdash;she the
      prisoner, I the judge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this with violent emotion, and with one arm outstretched over Pete's
      crouching head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could hear her voice, though&mdash;&mdash;perhaps her voice now&mdash;&mdash;I'm
      going to fall&mdash;&mdash;it's Kate, it's Kate! Oh! oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip had paused for several seconds, as if trying to listen, and then,
      with a loud cry of agony, he had closed his eyes and rolled back on to the
      pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God has meant me to hear all this,&rdquo; thought Pete. God had intended that
      for this, the peace of his soul, he should follow the phases of this drama
      of a naked heart. He was sobbing, but his sobs were like growls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's he doing now?&rdquo; thought Jem-y-Lord, craning his neck at the door.
      &ldquo;Shall I call for somebody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete had picked up from the floor the lock of hair that had been lying
      under his foot, and he was putting it back into Philip's breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but me between them,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;nothing but me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, sir,&rdquo; cried the unconscious man. It was only the last outbreak
      of Philip's delirium, but Pete trembled and shrank back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Philip groaned and his blue lips quivered. He opened his eyes. They
      wandered about the room for a moment, and afterwards fixed themselves on
      Pete in a long and haggard gaze. Pete's own eyes were too full of tears to
      be full of sight, but he could see that the change had come. He panted
      with expectation, and looked down at Philip with doglike delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's silence, and then, in a voice as faint as a breath,
      Philip murmured. &ldquo;What's&mdash;&mdash;where's&mdash;&mdash;is it Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that Pete uttered a shout of joy. &ldquo;He's himself! He's himself! Thank
      God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Philip helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you be bothering yourself now,&rdquo; cried Pete. &ldquo;Lie quiet, boy; you're
      in your own room, and as nice as nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;will you not kindly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not another word, Phil. It's nothing. You're all serene, and about as
      right as ninepence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Honour has been delirious,&rdquo; said Jem-y-Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chut!&rdquo; said Pete behind his hand, and then, with another joyful shout,
      &ldquo;Is it a beefsteak you'll be having, Phil, or a dish of tay and a
      herring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip looked perplexed. &ldquo;But could you not help me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he
      faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fainted in the Court-house, sir,&rdquo; said Jem-y-Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; It had all come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hould your whisht, you gawbie,&rdquo; whispered Pete, and he made a furtive
      kick at Jemmy's shins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete was laughing and crying in one breath. In the joyful reflux from evil
      passions the great fellow was like a boy. He poked the fire into a blaze,
      snuffed the candle with his fingers, sang out &ldquo;My gough!&rdquo; when he burnt
      them, and then hopped about the floor and cut as many capers as a swallow
      after a shower of rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip looked at him and relapsed into silence. It seemed as if he had
      been on a journey and something had happened in his absence. The secret
      which he had struggled so long to confess had somehow been revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jem-y-Lord was beating out his pillows. &ldquo;Does he know?&rdquo; said Philip.&mdash;
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; whispered Jemmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything. You have been delirious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delirious!&rdquo; said Philip, with alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he struggled to rise. &ldquo;Help me up. Let me go away. Why did you bring
      me here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't help it, sir. I tried to prevent&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot face him,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;I am afraid. Help me, help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too weak, sir. Lie still. No one shall harm you. The doctor is
      coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip sank back with a look of fear. &ldquo;Water,&rdquo; he cried feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said Jem-y-Lord, lifting from the dressing-table the jug out
      of which he had moistened the sponge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut!&rdquo; cried Pete, and he tipped the jug so that half the water spilled.
      &ldquo;Brandy for a man when he's in bed, you goosey gander. Hould, hard, boy;
      I've a taste of the rael stuff in the cupboard. Half a minute, mate. A
      drop will be doing no harm at all,&rdquo; and away he went down the stairs like
      a flood, almost sweeping over Nancy, who had come creeping up in her
      stockings at the sound of voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child had awakened in its cradle, and, with one dumpy leg over its
      little quilt, it was holding quiet converse with its toes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hollo, young cockalorum, is it there you are!&rdquo; shouted Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the next moment, with a noggin bottle of brandy in his fist, he was
      leaping upstairs, three steps at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Jem-y-Lord had edged up to the Deemster and whispered, with
      looks of fear and mystery, &ldquo;Don't take it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Philip vacantly.&mdash;&ldquo;The brandy,&rdquo; said Jem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Jem, but Pete's step was thundering up
      the stairs, and with a big opening of the mouth, rather than an audible
      utterance of the tongue, he added, &ldquo;poisoned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip could not comprehend, and Pete came shouting&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's your water, now, ould Snuff-the-Wind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Pete was pouring the brandy into a glass and adding the water, Jemmy
      caught up a scrap of newspaper that was lying about, rummaged for a
      pencil, wrote some words on the margin, tore the piece off, and smuggled
      it into the Deemster's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid of Pete!&rdquo; thought Philip. &ldquo;It is monstrous! monstrous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment there was the sound of a horse's hoofs on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor,&rdquo; cried Jem-y-Lord. &ldquo;The doctor at last. Wait, sir, wait,&rdquo; and
      he ran downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; cried Pete, coming to the bedside, glass in hand. &ldquo;Drink
      it up, boy. It'll stiffen you. My faith, but it's a oner. Aw, God is good,
      though. He's all that. He's good tremenjous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete was laughing; he was crying; he was tasting a new sweetness&mdash;the
      sweetness of being a good man again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was holding Jem-y-Lord's paper before his eyes, and trying to read
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this that Jemmy has given me?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Read it, Pete. My eyes
      are dazed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete took the paper in his left hand, still holding the glass in his
      right. To get the light on to the writing he went down on his knees by the
      bed-head and leaned over towards the fire. Then, like a school-boy
      repeating his task, he read in a singsong voice the words that Jem-y-Lord
      had written:&mdash;&ldquo;Don't drink the brandy. Pete is trying to kill you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete made a grating laugh. &ldquo;That's a pretty thing now,&rdquo; he began, but he
      could not finish. His laughter ceased, his eyes opened wide, his tongue
      seemed to hang out of his mouth, and he turned his head and looked back
      with an agony of doubt into Philip's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip struggled up. &ldquo;Give me the brandy, Pete.&rdquo; He took the glass out of
      Pete's hand, and without a second thought, with only a smile of faith and
      confidence, he raised it to his lips and drank. When the doctor entered
      the room a moment afterwards, Pete was sobbing into the bed-clothes, and
      Philip's hand was resting on his head.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Early the next morning Pete visited Kate in prison. He had something to
      say to her, something to ask; but he intended to keep back his own
      feelings, to bear himself bravely, to sustain the poor girl's courage. The
      light was cold and ashen within the prison walls, and as he followed the
      sergeant into the cell, he could not help but think of Kate as he had
      first known her, so bright, so merry, so full of life and gaiety. He found
      her now doubled up on a settle by a newly-kindled fire in the sergeant's
      own apartment. She lifted her head, with a terrified look, as he entered,
      and she saw his hollow cheeks and deep eyes and ragged beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not coming to trouble you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I've forgiven <i>him</i>, and
      I'm forgiving you, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good,&rdquo; she answered nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good?&rdquo; He gave a crack of bitter laughter. &ldquo;I meant to kill him&mdash;that's
      how good I am. And it's the same as if all the devils out of hell had been
      at me the night through to do it still. Maybe I hadn't much to forgive.
      I'm like a bat in the light&mdash;I'm not knowing where I am ezactly.
      Daresay the people will laugh at me when they're getting to know. Wouldn't
      trust, but they'll think me a poor-spirited cur, anyway. Let them&mdash;there's
      never much pity for the dog that's licked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice shook, although so hard and so husky. &ldquo;That's not what I came to
      say, though. You'll be laving this place soon, and I'm wanting to ask&mdash;I'm
      wanting to know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had covered her face, and now she said through her hands, &ldquo;Do as you
      like with me, Pete. You are my husband, and I must obey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at her for a moment. &ldquo;But you cannot love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have deceived you, and whatever you tell me to do I will do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you cannot love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be a good wife for the future* Pete&mdash;I will, indeed, indeed I
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you cannot love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to cry. &ldquo;That's enough,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'll not force you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good,&rdquo; she said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed more bitterly than before. &ldquo;Dou yo think I'm wanting your body
      while another man has your heart? That's a game I've played about long
      enough, I'm thinking. Good? Not me, missis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes, which had been fixed on the fire, wandered to his wife, and then
      his lips quivered and his manner changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm hard&mdash;I'll cut it short. Fact is, I've detarmined to do
      something, but I've a question to ask first. You've suffered since you
      left me, Kate. He has dragged you down a dale&mdash;but tell me, do you
      love him still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered and crept closer to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be freckened. It's a woman's way to love the man that's done wrong
      by her. Being good to her is nothing&mdash;sarvice is nothing&mdash;kindness
      is nothing. Maybe there's some ones that cry shame on her for that&mdash;but
      not me. Giving herself, body and soul, and thinking nothing what she gets
      for it&mdash;that's the glory of a woman when she cares for anybody. Spake
      up, Kate&mdash;do you love him in spite of all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer came in a whisper that was like a breath&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll do,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed his hand against the place of his old wound. &ldquo;I might have
      known you could never care for me&mdash;I might have known that,&rdquo; he said
      with difficulty. &ldquo;But don't think I can't stand my rackups, as the saying
      is. I know my course now&mdash;I know my job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was sobbing into her hands, and he was breathing fast and loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word more&mdash;only one&mdash;about the child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Katherine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I a right to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gasped audibly, but did not answer, and he tried a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she belong to me, Kate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her confusion increased. He tried a third time, speaking more gently than
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I should lave the island, Kate, could I&mdash;must I&mdash;may I take
      the child along with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that her fear got the better of her shame, and she cried, &ldquo;Don't take
      her away. Oh, don't, don't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pressed his hand hard at his side again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But maybe that's only mother's love, and what mother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off and then began once more, in a voice so low that it was
      scarcely to be heard. &ldquo;Tell me, when the time comes&mdash;and it will
      come, Kate, have no fear about that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was breaking down, he was struggling hard. &ldquo;When the time comes for
      himself and you to be together, will you be afraid to have the little one
      with you&mdash;will it seem wrong, Kate&mdash;you two and little Katherine&mdash;one
      household&mdash;one family&mdash;no?&mdash;n&mdash;o?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words seemed to come out of the depths of his throat. &ldquo;I've nothing
      more to think about. <i>He</i> must think of all the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What matter about me? D'ye think there's anything worse coming? D'ye
      think I'm caring what I ate, and what I drink, and what becomes of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was laughing again, and her sobs broke out afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God is good,&rdquo; he said more quietly. &ldquo;He'll take care of the likes of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His motionless eyes were on the crackling fire, and he stood in the light
      that flashed from it with a face like stone. &ldquo;I've no child now,&rdquo; he
      muttered, as though speaking to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slid to her knees at his feet, took the hand that hung by his side and
      began to cover it with kisses. &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I have been very
      weak and very guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the use of talking like that?&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;What's past is past,&rdquo;
       and he drew his hand away. &ldquo;No child now, no child now,&rdquo; he muttered
      again, as though his dispair cried out to God.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was feeling like a man wrecked in mid-ocean. A spar came floating
      towards him. It was all he could lay hold of from the foundering ship, in
      which he had sailed, and sung, and laughed, and slept. He had thought to
      save his life by it, but another man was clinging to it, and he had to
      drop it and go down.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not look into his face again; she could not touch his hand; she
      could not ask for his forgiveness. He stood over her for a moment without
      speaking, and then, with his hollow cheeks, and deep eyes, and ragged
      heard, he went away in the morning sunlight.

    <h2>
      XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Phillip fell into a deep sleep. When he awoke, he saw, as in a mirror, a
      solution to the tumultuous drama of his life. It was a glorious solution,
      a liberating and redeeming end, an end bringing freedom from the bonds
      which had beset him. What matter if it was hard; if it was difficult; if
      it was bitter as Marah and steep as Calvary? He was ready, he was eager.
      Oh, blessed sleep! Oh, wise and soothing sleep I It had rent the dark
      cloud of his past and given the flash of light that illumined the path
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened his eyes and saw Auntie Nan seated by his side, reading a volume
      of sermons. At the change in his breathing the old dove looked round,
      dropped the book, and began to flutter about. &ldquo;Hush, dearest, hush!&rdquo; she
      whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a heavy, monotonous sound, like the beating of a distant drum or
      the throb of an engine under the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, dearest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What day is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sunday. Oh, you've had a long, long sleep, Philip. You slept all day
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the church-bell ringing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear, and a fine morning, too&mdash;so soft and springlike. I'll
      open the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my hearing must be injured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! they muffled the bell&mdash;that's it. 'The church is so near,' they
      said, 'it might trouble him.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A carriage was coming down the road. It rattled on the paved way; then the
      rattling ceased, and there was a dull rumble as of a cart sliding on to a
      wooden bridge. &ldquo;That horse has fallen,&rdquo; said Philip, trying to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only the straw on the street,&rdquo; said Auntie Nan. &ldquo;The people brought
      it from all parts. 'We must deaden the traffic by the house,' they said.
      Oh, you couldn't think how good they've been. Yesterday was market-day,
      but there was no business done. Couldn't have been; they were coming and
      going the whole day long. 'And how's the Deemster now?' 'And how's he
      now?' It was fit to make you cry. I believe in my heart, Philip, nobody in
      Ramsey went to bed the first night at all. Everybody waiting and waiting
      to see if there wasn't something to fetch, and the kettle kept boiling in
      every kitchen round about. But hush, dearest, hush! Not so much talking
      all at once. Hush, now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Pete?&rdquo; asked Philip, his face to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oiling the hinges of the door, dearest. He was laying carpets on the
      stairs all day yesterday. But never the sound of a hammer. The man's
      wonderful. He must have hands like iron. His heart's soft enough, though.
      But then everybody is so kind&mdash;everybody, everybody! The doctor, and
      the vicar, and the newspapers&mdash;oh, it's beautiful! It's just as Pete
      was saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was Pete saying, Auntie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was saying the angels must think there's somebody sick in every house
      in the island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sound of singing came through the open window, above the whisper of
      young leaves and the twitter of birds. It was the psalm that was being
      sung in church&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Blessed is the man that considereth the poor and needy;
      The Lord shall deliver him in time of trouble.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Philip. That must be a special psalm. I'm sure they're singing it
      for you. How sweet of them! But we are talking too much, dear. The doctor
      will scold. I must leave you now, Philip. Only for a little, though, while
      I go back to Bal lure, and I'll send up Cottier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, send up Cottier,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; said the old soul, looking down as she tied her bonnet
      strings. &ldquo;You'll lie quiet now? You're sure you'll lie quiet? Well, good
      bye! good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Philip lay alone the soar and swell of the psalm filled the room. Oh,
      the irony of it all! The frantic, hideous, awful irony! He was lying
      there, he, the guilty one, with the whole island watching at his bedside,
      pitying him, sorrowing for him, holding its breath until he should
      breathe, and she, his partner, his victim, his innocent victim, was in
      jail, in disgrace, in a degradation more deep than death. Still the psalm
      soared and swelled. He tried to bury his head in the pillows that he might
      not hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jem-y-Lord came in hurriedly and Philip beckoned him close. &ldquo;Where is
      she?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They removed her to Castle Rushen late last night, your Honour,&rdquo; said
      Jemmy softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write immediately to the Clerk of the Bolls,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;Say she must
      be lodged on the debtors' side and have patients' diet and every comfort.
      My Kate! my Kate!&rdquo; he kept saying, &ldquo;it shall not be for long, not for
      long, my love, not for long!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The convalescence was slow and Philip was impatient. &ldquo;I feel better
      to-day, doctor,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;don't you think I may get out of bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Traa dy liooar</i> (time enough), Deemster,&rdquo; the doctor would answer.
      &ldquo;Let us see what a few more days will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a great task before me, doctor,&rdquo; he would say again. &ldquo;I must begin
      immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a life's work before you, Deemster, and you must begin soon, but
      not just yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have something particular to do, doctor,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I must lose
      no time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must lose no time indeed, that's why you must stay where you are a
      little longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One morning his impatience overcame him, and he got out of bed. But, being
      on his feet, his head reeled, his limbs trembled, he clutched at the
      bed-post, and had to clamber back. &ldquo;Oh God, bear me witness, this delay is
      not my fault,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the day he longed for the night, that he might close his eyes
      in the darkness and think of Kate. He tried to think of her as she used to
      be&mdash;bright, happy, winsome, full of joy, of love, of passion,
      dangling her feet from the apple-tree, or tripping along the tree-trunk in
      the glen, teasing him? tempting him. It was impossible. He could only
      think of her in, the gloom of the prison. That filled his mind with
      terrors. Sometimes in the dark hours his enfeebled body beset his brain
      with fantastic hallucinations. Calling for paper and pens, he would make
      show of writing a letter, producing no words or intelligible signs, but
      only a mass of scrawls and blotches. This he would fold and refold with
      great elaboration, and give to Jem y-Lord with an air of gravity and
      mystery, saying in a whisper, &ldquo;For her!&rdquo; Thus night brought no solace, and
      the dawn found him waiting for the day, that he might open his eyes in the
      sunlight and think, &ldquo;She is better where she is; God will comfort her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fortnight went by and he saw nothing of Pete. At length he made a call
      on his courage and said, &ldquo;Auntie, why does Pete never come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does, dearest. Only when you're asleep, though. He stands there in the
      doorway in his stockings. I nod to him and he comes in and looks down at
      you. Then he goes away without a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he doing now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to Douglas a good deal seemingly. Indeed, they're saying&mdash;but
      then people are so fond of talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are people saying, Auntie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's about a divorce, dearest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip groaned and turned away his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened his eyes one day from a doze, and saw the plain face of Nancy
      Joe, framed in a red print handkerchief. The simple creature was talking
      with Auntie Nan, holding council, and making common cause with the dainty
      old lady as unmarried women and old maids both of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why don't you keep your word true?' says I. 'Wasn't you saying you'd
      take her back,' says I, 'whatever she'd done and whatever she was, so help
      you God?' says I. 'Isn't she shamed enough already, poor thing, without
      you going shaming her more? Have you no bowels at all? Are you only
      another of the gutted herrings on a stick?' says I. 'Why don't you keep
      your word true?' 'Because,' says he, 'I want to be even with the other
      one,' says he, and then away he went wandering down by the tide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's unchristian, Nancy,&rdquo; said Auntie Nan, &ldquo;but it's human; for although
      he forgives the woman, he can hardly be expected to forgive the man, and
      he can't punish one without punishing both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much good it'll do to punish either, say I. What for should he put up his
      fins now the hook's in his gizzard? But that's the way with the men still.
      Talking and talking of love and love; but when trouble is coming, no
      better than a churn of sour cream on a thundery day. We're best off that
      never had no truck with them&mdash;I don't know what you think, Miss
      Christian, ma'am. They may talk about having no chances&mdash;I don't mind
      if they do&mdash;do you? I had chance enough once, though&mdash;I don't
      know what you've had, ma'am. I had one sweetheart, anyway&mdash;a sort of
      a sweetheart, as you might say; but he was sweeter on the money than on
      me. Always asking how much I had got saved in the stocking. And when he
      heard I had three new dresses done, 'Nancy,' says he, 'we had better be
      putting a sight up on the parzon now, before they're all wore out at
      you.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor, who was still in London, wrote a letter full of tender
      solicitude and graceful compliment. The Clerk of the Rolls had arranged
      from the first that two telegrams should be sent to him daily, giving
      accounts of Philip's condition. At last the Clerk came in person, and
      threw Auntie Nan into tremors of nervousness by his noise and
      robustious-ness. He roared as he came along the path, roared himself
      through the hall, up the stairs, and into the bedroom, roared again as he
      set eyes on Philip, protesting that the sick man was worth five hundred
      dead men yet, and vowing with an oath (and a tear trickling down his nose)
      that he would like to give &ldquo;time&rdquo; to the fools who frightened good people
      with bad reports. Then he cleared the room for a private consultation.
      &ldquo;Out you go, Cottier. Look slippy, man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Auntie Nan fled in terror. When she had summoned resolution to invade
      afresh the place of the bear that had possession of her lamb, the Clerk of
      the Rolls was rising from the foot of the bed and saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll leave it at that then, Christian. These d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      things <i>will</i> happen; but don't you bother your head about it. I'll
      make it all serene. Besides, it's nothing&mdash;nothing in a lifetime.
      I'll have to send you the summons, though. You needn't trouble about that;
      just toss it into the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip's head was down, his eyes were on the counterpane, and a faint
      tinge of colour overspread his wasted face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you're back, Miss Christian? I must be going, though. Good-bye, old
      fellow! Take care of yourself&mdash;good men are scarce. Good-bye, Miss
      Christian! Good-bye, all! Good-bye, Phil! God bless you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he went roaring down the stairs, but came thunging up again in a
      moment, put his head round the doorpost, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord bless my soul, if I wasn't forgetting an important bit of news&mdash;very
      important news, too! It hasn't got into the papers yet, but I've had the
      official wrinkle. What d'ye think?&mdash;the Governor has resigned! True
      as gospel. Sent in his resignation to the Home Office the night before
      last. I saw it coming. He hasn't been at home since Tynwald. Look sharp
      and get better now. Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip got up for the first time the day following. The weather was soft
      and full of whispers of spring; the window was open and Philip sat with
      his face in the direction of the sea. Auntie Nan was knitting by his side
      and running on with homely gossip. The familiar and genial talk was
      floating over the surface of his mind as a sea-bird floats over the
      surface of the sea, sometimes reflected in it, sometimes skimming it,
      sometimes dipping into it and being lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Pete! The good woman here thinks he's hard. Perhaps he is; but I'm
      sure he is much to be pitied. Ross has behaved badly and deserves all that
      can come to him. 'He's the same to me as you are, dear&mdash;in blood, I
      mean&mdash;but somehow I can't be sorry.... Ah! you're too tender-hearted,
      Philip, indeed you are. You'd find excuses for anybody. The doctor says
      overwork, dearest; but <i>I</i> say the shock of seeing that poor creature
      in that awful position. And what a shock you gave me, too! To tell you the
      truth, Philip, I thought it was a fate. Never heard of it? No? Never heard
      that grandfather fainted on the bench? He did, though, and he didn't
      recover either. How well I remember it! Word broke over the town like a
      clap of thunder, 'The Deemster has fallen in the Court-house.' Father
      heard it up at Ballure and ran down bareheaded. Grandfather's carriage was
      at the Courthouse door, and they brought him up to Ballawhaine. I remember
      I was coming downstairs when I saw the carriage draw up at the gate. The
      next minute your father, with his wild eyes and his bare head, was lifting
      something out of the inside. Poor Tom! He had never set foot in the house
      since grandfather had driven him out of it. And little did grandfather
      think in whose arms he was to travel the last stage of his life's
      journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip had fallen asleep. Jem-y-Lord entered with a letter. It was in a
      large envelope and had come by the insular post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I open it?&rdquo; thought Auntie Nan. She had been opening and replying
      to Philip's letters during the time of his illness, but this one bore an
      official seal, and so she hesitated. &ldquo;Shall I?&rdquo; she thought, with the
      knitting needle to her lip. &ldquo;I will. I may save him some worry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fixed her glasses and drew out the letter. It was a summons from the
      Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice&mdash;a petition for
      divorce. The petitioner's name was Peter Quilliam; the respondent&mdash;&mdash;,
      the co respondent&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Philip awoke from his doze, with the salt breath of the sea in his
      nostrils and the songs of spring in his ears, Auntie Nan was fumbling with
      the paper to get it back into the envelope. Her hands trembled, and when
      she spoke her voice quivered. Philip saw in a moment what had happened.
      She had stumbled into the pit where the secret of his life lay buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor came in at that instant. He looked attentively at Auntie Nan,
      and said significantly, &ldquo;You have been nursing too long, Miss Christian,
      you must go home for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go home at once,&rdquo; she faltered, in a feeble inward voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip's head was on his breast. Such was the first step on the Calvary he
      intended to ascend. O God, help him! God support him! God bear up his
      sinking feet that he might not fall from weakness, or fear, or shame.

    <h2>
      XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cæsar visited Kate at Castle Rushen. He found her lodged in a large and
      light apartment (once the dining-room of the Lords of Man), indulged with
      every comfort, and short of nothing but her liberty. As the turnkey pulled
      the door behind him, Cæsar lifted both hands and cried, &ldquo;The Lord is my
      refuge and my strength; a very present help in trouble.&rdquo; Then he inquired
      if Pete had been there before him, and being answered &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;The
      children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of
      light.&rdquo; After that he fell to the praise of the Deemster, who had not only
      given Kate these mercies, comfortable to her carnal body, if dangerous to
      her soul, but had striven to lighten the burden of her people at the time
      when he had circulated the report of her death, knowing she was dead
      indeed, dead in trespasses and sins, and choosing rather that they should
      mourn her as one who was already dead in fact, than feel shame for her as
      one that was yet alive in iniquity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, he dropped his handkerchief on to the slate floor,-went down on
      one knee by the side of his tall hat, and called on her in prayer to cast
      in her lot afresh with the people of God. &ldquo;May her lightness be rebuked, O
      Lord!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Give her to know that until she repents she hath no
      place among Thy children. And, Lord, succour Thy servant in his hour of
      tribulation. Let him be well girt up with Christian armour. Help him to
      cry aloud, amid his tears and his lamentations, 'Though my heart and hers
      should break, Thy name shall not be dishonoured, my Lord and my God!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rising from his knee and dusting it, Cæsar took up his tall hat, and left
      Kate as he had found her, crouching by the fire inside the wide ingle of
      the old hall, covering her face and saying nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in this mood of spiritual exaltation as he descended the steps into
      the Keep, and came upon a man in the dress of a prisoner sweeping with a
      besom. It was Black Tom. Cæsar stopped in front of him, moved his lips,
      lifted his face to the sky, shut both eyes, then opened them again, and
      said in a voice of deep sorrow, &ldquo;Aw, Thomas! Thomas Quilliam! I'm taking
      grief to see thee, man. An ould friend, whose hand has rested in my hand,
      and swilling the floor of a prison! Well, I warned thee often. But thou
      wast ever stony ground, Thomas. And now thou must see for thyself whether
      was I right that honesty is the better policy. Look at thee, and look at
      me. The Lord has delivered me, and prospered me even in temporal things. I
      have lands and I have houses. And what hast thou thyself? Nothing but thy
      conscience and thy disgrace. Even thy very clothes they have taken away
      from thee, and they would take thy hair itself if thou had any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Black Tom stood with feet flatly planted apart, rested himself on the
      shank of his besom, and said, &ldquo;Don't be playing cammag (shindy) with me,
      Mr. Holy Ghoster. It isn't honesty that's making the diff'rance between us
      at all&mdash;it's luck. You've won and I've lost, you've succeeded and
      I've failed, you're wearing your chapel hat and I'm in this bit of a
      saucepan lid, but you're only a reg'lar ould Pharisee, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar waved his hand. &ldquo;I can't take the anger with thee, Thomas,&rdquo; he said,
      backing himself out. &ldquo;I thought the devil had been chained since our last
      camp-meeting, but I was wrong seemingly. He goeth about still like a
      raging lion, seeking whom he may devour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be trying to knock me down with your tex'es,&rdquo; said Thomas,
      shouldering his besom. &ldquo;Any cock can crow on his own midden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't help it, Thomas,&rdquo; said Cæsar, edging away. &ldquo;It isn't my ould
      friend that's blaspheming at all. It's the devil that has entered into his
      heart and is rending him. But cast the devil out, man, or hell will be thy
      portion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was there last night in my dreams, Cæsar,&rdquo; said Black Tom, following
      him up. &ldquo;'Oh, Lord Devil, let me in,' says I. 'Where d'ye come from?' says
      he. 'The Isle of Man,' says I. 'I'm not taking any more from there till my
      Bishop comes,' says he. 'Who's that?' says I. 'Bishop Cæsar, the publican&mdash;who
      else?' says he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I marvel at thee, Thomas,&rdquo; said Cæsar, half through the small door of the
      portcullis, &ldquo;but the sons of Belial have to fight hard for his throne.
      I'll pray for thee, though, that it be not remembered against thee
      when(D.V.) there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night Cæsar visited the Deemster at Elm Cottage. His eyes glittered,
      and there was a look of frenzy in his face. He was still in his mood of
      spiritual pride, and when he spoke it was always with the thees and the
      thous and in the high pitch of the preacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Ballawhaine is dead, your Honour,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;They wouldn't have me
      tell thee before because of thy body's weakness, but now they suffer it.
      Groanings and moanings and 'stericks of torment! Ter'ble sir, ter'ble!
      Took a notion he would have water poured out for him at the last. It
      couldn't wash him clane, though. And shouting with his dying voice, 'I've
      sinned, O God, I've sinned!' Oh, I delivered my soul, sir; he can clear me
      of that, anyway. 'Lay hould of a free salvation,' says I. 'I've not lived
      a right life,' says he. 'Truth enough,' says I; 'you've lived a life of
      carnal freedom, but now is the appointed time. Say, &ldquo;Lord, I belaive; help
      thou my unbelaife.&rdquo;' 'Too late, Mr. Cregeen, too late,' says he, and the
      word was scarce out of his mouth when he was key-cold in a minute, and
      gone into the night of all flesh that's lost. Well, it was his own son
      that killed him, sir; robbed him of every silver sixpence and ruined him.
      The last mortgage he raised was to keep the young man out of prison for
      forgery. Bad, sir, bad! To indulge a child to its own damnation is bad. A
      human infirmity, though; and I'm feeling for the poor sinner myself being
      tempted&mdash;that is to say inclining&mdash;but thank the Lord for his
      strengthening arm&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he buried?&rdquo; asked Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buried enough, and a poor funeral too, sir,&rdquo; said Cæsar, walking the room
      with a proud step, the legs straightened, the toes conspicuously turned
      out. &ldquo;Driving rain and sleet, sir, the wind in the trees, the grass wet to
      your calf, and the parson in his white smock under the umbrella. Nobody
      there to spake of, neither; only myself and the tenants mostly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was Ross?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone, sir, without waiting to see his foolish ould father pushed under
      the sod. Well, there was not much to wait for neither. The young man has
      been a besom of fire and burnt up everything. Not so much left as would
      buy a rope to hang him. And Ballawhaine is mine, sir; mine in a way of
      spak-ing&mdash;my son-in-law's, anyway&mdash;and he has given me the right
      to have and to hould it. Aw, a Sabbath time, sir; a Sabbath time. I made
      up my mind to have it the night the man struck me in my own house in
      Sulby. He betrayed my daughter at last, sir, and took her from her home,
      and then her husband lent six thousand pounds on mortgage. 'Do what you
      like with it,' said he, and I said to myself, 'The man shall starve; he
      shall be a beggar; he shall have neither bread to eat, nor water to drink,
      nor a roof to cover him.' And the moment the breath was out of the ould
      man's body I foreclosed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was trembling from head to foot. &ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; he faltered, &ldquo;that
      that was your reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the Lord's hand on a rascal,&rdquo; said Cæsar, &ldquo;and proud am I to be the
      instrument of his vengeance. 'God moves in a mysterious way,' sir. Oh, the
      Lord is opening His word more and more. And I have more to tell thee, too.
      Balla-whaine would belong to thyself, sir, if every one had his rights. It
      was thy grandfather's inheritance, and it should have been thy father's,
      and it ought to be thine. Take it, sir, take it on thy own terms; it is
      worth a matter of twelve thousand, but thou shalt have it for nine, and
      pay for it when the Lord gives thee substance. Thou hast been good to me
      and to mine, and especially to the poor lost lamb who lies in the Castle
      to-night in her shame and disgrace. Little did I think I should ever repay
      thee, though. But it is the Lord's doings. It is marvellous in our eyes.
      'Deep in unfathomable mines'&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar was pacing the room and speaking in tones of rapture. Philip, who
      was sitting at the table, rose from it with a look of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frightful! frightful!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;A mistake! a mistake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord God makes no mistakes, sir,&rdquo; cried Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what if it was not Ross&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Philip. Cæsar paid no
      heed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if it was not Ross&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Cæsar glanced over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if it was some one else&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Philip. Cæsar stopped in
      front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one you have never thought of&mdash;some one you have respected and
      even held in honour&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, then?&rdquo; said Cæsar huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cregeen,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;it is hard for me to speak. I had not
      intended to speak yet; but I should hold myself in horror if I were silent
      now. You have been living in awful error. Whatever the cost, whatever the
      consequences, you must not remain in that error a moment longer. It was
      not Ross who took away your daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo; cried Cæsar. His voice had the sound of a cracked bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip struggled hard. He tried to confess. His eyes wandered about the
      walls. &ldquo;As you have cherished a mistaken resentment,&rdquo; he faltered, &ldquo;so you
      have nourished a mistaken gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? who?&rdquo; cried Cæsar, looking fixedly into Philip's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip's rigid fingers were crawling over the papers on the table like the
      claws of crabs. They touched the summons from the Chancery Court, and he
      picked it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read this,&rdquo; he said, and held it out to Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar took it, but continued to look at Philip with eyes that were
      threatening in their wildness. Philip felt that in a moment their
      positions had been changed. He was the judge no longer, but only a
      criminal at the bar of this old man, this grim fanatic, half-mad already
      with religious mania.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord of Hosts is mighty,&rdquo; muttered Cæsar; and then Philip heard the
      paper crinkle in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar was feeling for his spectacles. When he had liberated them from the
      sheath, he put them on the bridge of his nose upside down. With the two
      glasses against the wrinkles of his forehead and his eyes still uncovered,
      he held the paper at arm's length and tried to read it. Then he took out
      his red print handkerchief to dust the spectacles. Fumbling spectacles and
      sheath and handkerchief and paper in his trembling hands together, he
      muttered again in a quavering voice, as if to fortify himself against what
      he was to see, &ldquo;The Lord of Hosts is mighty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He read the paper at length, and there was no mistaking it. &ldquo;Quilliam v.
      Quilliam and Christian (Philip).&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid the summons on the table, and returned his spectacles to their
      sheath. His breathing made noises in his nostrils. &ldquo;<i>Ugh cha nee!</i>&rdquo;
       (woe is me), he muttered. &ldquo;<i>Ugh cha nee! Ugh cha nee!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he looked helplessly around and said, &ldquo;Depart from me, for I am a
      sinful man, O Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The vengeance that he had built up day by day had fallen in a moment into
      ruins. His hypocrisy was stripped naked. &ldquo;I see how it is,&rdquo; he said in a
      hoarse voice. &ldquo;The Lord has de-ceaved me to punish me. It is the
      public-house. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. What's gained on the devil's
      back is lost under his belly. I thought I was a child of God, but the
      deceitfulness of riches has choked the word. <i>Ugh cha nee! Ugh cha nee!</i>
      My prosperity has been like the quails, only given with the intent of
      choking me. <i>Ugh cha nee!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His spiritual pride was broken down. The Almighty had refused to be made a
      tool of. He took up his hat and rolled his arm over it the wrong way of
      the nap. Half-way to the door he paused. &ldquo;Well, I'll be laving you;
      good-day, sir,&rdquo; he said, nodding his head slowly. &ldquo;The Lord's been knowing
      what you were all the time seemingly. But what's the use of His knowing&mdash;He
      never tells on nobody. And I've been calling on sinners to flee from the
      wrath, and He's been letting the devils make a mock at myself! <i>Ugh cha
      nee! Ugh cha nee!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip had slipped back in his chair, and his head had fallen forward' on
      the table. He heard the old man go out; he heard his heavy step drop
      slowly down the stairs; he heard his foot dragging on the path outside. &ldquo;<i>Ugh
      cha nee! Ugh cha nee!</i>&rdquo; The word rang in his heart like a knell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jem-y-Lord, who had been out in the town, came back in great excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such news, your Honour! Such splendid news!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Philip, without lifting his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're signing petitions all over the island, asking the Queen to make
      you Governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God in heaven!&rdquo; said Philip; &ldquo;that would be frightful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Philip was fit to go out, they brought up a carriage and drove him
      round the bay. The town had awakened from its winter sleep, and the
      harbour was a busy and cheerful scene. More than a hundred men had come
      from their crofts in the country, and were making their boats ready for
      the mackerel-fishing at Kinsale. There was a forest of masts where the
      flat hulls had been, the taffrails and companions were touched up with
      paint, and the newly-barked nets were being hauled over the quay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Dempster,&rdquo; cried the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all saluted him, and some of them, after their Manx fashion, drew up
      at the carriage-door, lifted their caps with their tarry hands, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taking joy to see you out again, Dempster. When a man's getting over an
      attack like that, it's middling clear the Lord's got work for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip answered with smiles and bows and cheerful words, but the kindness
      oppressed him. He was thinking of Kate. She was the victim of his success.
      For all that he received she had paid the penalty. He thought of her
      dreams, her golden dreams, her dreams of going up side by side and hand in
      hand with the man she loved. &ldquo;Oh, my love, my love!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Only a
      little longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was waiting for him when he reached home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have something to say to you, Deemster,&rdquo; he said, with averted face.
      &ldquo;It's about your aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she ill?&rdquo; said Philip.&mdash;&ldquo;Very ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I've inquired daily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By her express desire the truth has been kept back from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The carriage is still at the door&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've never seen any one sink so rapidly. She's all nerve. No doubt the
      nursing exhausted her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not that&mdash;I'll go up immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was to expect you at five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot wait,&rdquo; said Philip, and in a moment he was on the road. &ldquo;O God!&rdquo;
       he thought, &ldquo;how steep is the path I have to tread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On getting to Ballure, he pushed through the hall and stepped upstairs. At
      the door of Auntie Nan's bedroom he was met by Martha, the housemaid, now
      the nurse. She looked surprised, and made some nervous show of shutting
      him out. Before she could dc so he was already in the room. The air was
      heavy with the smell of medicines and vinegar and the odours of sick life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Martha, with a movement of lips and eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Auntie Nan was asleep in a half-sitting position on the bed. It was a
      shock to see the change in her. The beautiful old face was white and drawn
      with pain; the chin was hanging heavily; the eyes were half open; there
      was no cap on her head; her hair was straggling loosely and was dull as
      tow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be very ill,&rdquo; said Philip under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Martha. &ldquo;She wasn't expecting you until five, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has the doctor told her? Does she know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; but she doesn't mind that. She knows she's dying, and is quite
      resigned&mdash;quite&mdash;and quite cheerful&mdash;but she fears if you
      knew&mdash;hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a movement on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll be shocked if she&mdash;and she's not ready to receive&mdash;in
      here, sir,&rdquo; whispered Martha, and she motioned to the back of a screen
      that stood between the door and the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a deep sigh, a sound as of the moistening of dry lips, and then
      the voice of Auntie Nan&mdash;not her own familiar voice, but a sort of
      vanishing echo of it. &ldquo;What is the time, Martha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty minutes wanting five, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So late! It wasn't nice of you to let me sleep so long, Martha. I'm
      expecting the Governor at five. What a mercy he hasn't come earlier. It
      wouldn't be right to keep him waiting, and then&mdash;bring me the sponge,
      girl. Moisten it first. Now the towel. The comb next. That's better. How
      lifeless my hair is, though. Oil, you say? I wonder! I've never used it in
      my life: but at a time like this&mdash;well, just a little, then&mdash;there,
      that will do. Bring me a cap&mdash;the one with the pink bow in it. My
      face is so pale&mdash;it will give me a little colour. That will do. You
      couldn't tell I had been ill, could you? Not very ill, anyway? Now side
      everything away. The medicines too&mdash;put them in the cupboard. So many
      bottles. 'How ill she must have been!' he would say. And now open the
      drawer on the left, Martha, the one with the key in it, and bring me the
      paper on the top. Yes, the white paper. The folded one with the
      endorsement. Endorsement means writing on the back, Martha. Ah! I've lived
      all my life among lawyers. Lay it on the counterpane. The keys? Lay them
      beside it. No, put them behind my pillow, just at my back. Yes, there&mdash;lower,
      though, deeper still&mdash;that's right. Now set a chair, so that he can
      sit beside me. This side of the bed&mdash;no, this side. Then the light
      will be on him, and I will be able to see his face&mdash;my eyes are not
      so good as they were, you know. A little farther back&mdash;not quite so
      much, neither&mdash;that will do. Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long breath of satisfaction, and then Auntie Nan said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it's&mdash;&mdash;what time is it now, Martha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten minutes wanting five, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you tell Jane about the cutlets? He likes them with bread-crumbs, you
      know. I hope she won't forget to say 'Your Excellency.' I shall hear his
      voice the moment he comes into the hall. My ears are no worse, if my eyes
      are. Perhaps he won't speak, though, 'She's been so ill,' he'll think.
      Martha, I think you had better open the door. Jane is so forgetful. She
      might say things, too. If he asks, 'How is she to-day, Martha'' you must
      answer quite brightly, 'Better to-day, your Excellency.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an exclamation of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Ugh&mdash;Oo! Oh, blessed Lord Jesus!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure you are well enough, ma'am? Hadn't I better tell him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'll be worse to-morrow, and the next day worse still. Give me a dose
      of medicine, Martha&mdash;the morning medicine&mdash;the one that makes me
      cheerful. Thank you, Martha. If I feel the pain when he is here, I'll bear
      it as long as I can, and then I'll say, 'I'm finding myself drowsy,
      Philip; you had better go and lie down.' Will you understand that,
      Martha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am,&rdquo; said Martha.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid we must be a little deceitful, Martha. But we can't help that,
      can we? You see he has to be installed yet, and that is always a great
      excitement. If he thought I was very ill, now&mdash;<i>very</i>, very ill,
      you know&mdash;yes, I really think he would wish to postpone it, and I
      wouldn't have that for worlds and worlds. He has always been so fond of
      his old auntie. Well, it's the way with these boys. I daresay people
      wonder why he has never married, being so great and so prosperous. That
      was for my sake. He knew I should&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was breathing heavily. Auntie Nan listened. &ldquo;I'm sure there's
      somebody in the hall, Martha. Is it&mdash;&mdash;? Yes, it's&mdash;&mdash;;
      Go down to him quick&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am,&rdquo; said Martha, making a noise with the screen to cover
      Philip's escape on tiptoe. Then she came to him on the landing, wiping her
      eyes with her apron, and pretended to lead Philip back to the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy! my boy!&rdquo; cried Auntie Nan, and she folded him in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The transformation was wonderful. She had a look of youth now, almost a
      look of gaiety. &ldquo;I've heard the great, great news,&rdquo; she whispered, taking
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's only a rumour, Auntie,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;Are you better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but it will come true. Yes, yes, I'm better. I'm sure it will come
      true. And, dear heart, what a triumph! I dreamt it all the night before I
      heard of it. You were on the top of the Tynwald, and there was a great
      crowd. But come and sit down and tell me everything. So you are better
      yourself? Quite strong again, dear? Oh, yes, any where, Philip-sit
      anywhere. Here, this chair will do&mdash;this one by my side. Ah! How well
      you look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was carried away by her own gaiety. Leaning back on the pillow, but
      still keeping his hand in hers, she said, &ldquo;Do you know, Philip Christian,
      who is the happiest person in the world? I'm sure you don't, for all
      you're so clever. So I'll tell you. Perhaps you think it's a beautiful
      young wife just married to a husband who worships her. Well, you're quite,
      quite wrong, sir. It's an old, old lady, very, very old, and very feeble,
      just tottering on, and not expecting to live a great while longer, but
      with her sons about her, grown up, and big, and strong, and having all the
      world before them. That's the happiest person on earth. And I'm the next
      thing to it, for my boy&mdash;my own boy's boy&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She broke off, and then, with a far-off look, she said, &ldquo;I wonder will he
      think I've done my duty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she turned to the maid and said, quite gaily, &ldquo;You needn't wait,
      Martha. His Excellency will call you when I want my medicine. Won't you,
      your Excellency?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip could not find it in his heart to correct her again. The girl left
      the room. Auntie Nan glanced at the closing door, then reached over to
      Philip with an air of great mystery, and whispered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't be shocked, Philip, or surprised, or fancy I'm very ill, or
      that I'm going to die; but what do you think I've done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've made my will! Is that very terrible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've done right, Auntie,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the High Bailiff has been up and everything is in order, every
      little thing. See,&rdquo; and she lifted the paper that the maid had laid on the
      counterpane. &ldquo;Let me tell you.&rdquo; She nodded her head as she ran over the
      items. &ldquo;Some little legacies first, you know. There's Martha, such a good
      girl&mdash;I've left her my silk dresses. Then old Mary, the housemaid at
      Ballawhaine. Poor old thing! she's been down with rheumatism three years,
      and flock beds get so lumpy&mdash;I've left her my feather one. I thought
      at first I should like you to have my little income. Do you know, your old
      auntie is quite an old miser. I've grown so fond of my little money. And
      it seemed so sweet to think&mdash;but then you don't want it now, Philip.
      It would be nothing to you, would it? I've been thinking, though&mdash;now,
      what do you think I've been thinking of doing with my little fortune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip stroked the wrinkled fingers with his other hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's right, I'm sure, Auntie. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would never guess.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been thinking,&rdquo; with sudden gravity. &ldquo;Philip, there's nobody in the
      world so unhappy as a poor gentlewoman who has slipped and fallen. Then
      this one's father, he has turned his back on her, they're telling me, and
      of course she can't expect anything from her husband. I've been thinking,
      now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Philip, with his eyes down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you the truth, I've been thinking it would be so nice&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, nervously, faltering, in a quavering voice, with many excuses,
      out came the great secret, the mighty strategy. Auntie Nan had willed her
      fortune to Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're an angel, Auntie,&rdquo; said Philip in a thick voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he saw through her artifice. She was talking of Kate, but she was
      thinking of himself. She was trying to relieve him of an embarrassment; to
      remove an impediment that lay in his path; to liberate his conscience; to
      cover up his fault; to conceal everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then this house, dear,&rdquo; said Auntie Nan. &ldquo;It's yours, but you'll
      never want it. It's been a dear little harbour of refuge, but the storm is
      over now. Would you&mdash;do you see any objection&mdash;perhaps you might&mdash;could
      you not let the poor soul come and live here with her little one, after I&mdash;when
      all is over, I mean&mdash;and she is&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip could not speak. He took the wrinkled hand and drew it up to his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old soul was beside herself with joy. &ldquo;Then you're sure I've done
      right? Quite sure? Lock it up in the drawer again, dearest The top one on
      the left. Oh, the keys? Dear me, yes; where are the keys? How tiresome! I
      remember now. They're at the back of my pillow. Will you call Martha? Or
      perhaps you would yourself&mdash;will you?&rdquo; (very artfully)&mdash;&ldquo;you
      don't mind then? Yes, that's it; more this way, though, a little more&mdash;ah!
      My boy! my boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old dove's second strategy had succeeded also. In fumbling behind her
      pillow for the keys, Philip had to put his arms about her again, and she
      was kissing him on the forehead and on the cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a spasm of pain. It dragged at her features, but her smile
      struggled through it. She fetched a difficult breath, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now&mdash;dear&mdash;I'm finding myself&mdash;a little drowsy&mdash;how
      selfish of me&mdash;your cutlets&mdash;browned&mdash;nicely browned&mdash;breadcrumbs,
      you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip fled from the room and summoned Martha. He wandered aimlessly about
      the house for hours that night. At one moment he found himself in the blue
      room, Auntie Nan's workroom, so full of her familiar things&mdash;the
      spinning-wheel, the frame of the sampler, the old-fashioned piano, the
      scent of lavender&mdash;all the little evidences of her presence, so
      dainty, so orderly, so sweet A lamp was burning for the convenience of the
      doctor, but there was no fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor came again towards ten o'clock. There was nothing to be done;
      nothing to be hoped; still she might live until morning, if&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight Philip crept noiselessly to the bedroom. The condition was
      unaltered. He was going to lie down, but wished to be awakened if there
      was any change.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was long before he dropped off, and he seemed to have slept only a
      moment when there was a knocking at his door. He heard it while he was
      still sleeping. The dawn had broken, the streamers of the sun were rising
      out of the sea. A sparrow in the garden was hacking the air with its
      monotonous chirp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Auntie Nan was far spent, yet the dragging expression of pain was gone,
      and a serenity almost angelic overspread her face. When she recognised
      Philip she felt for his hand, guided it to her heart, and kept it there.
      Only a few words did she speak, for her breath was short. She commended
      her soul to God. Then, with a look of pallid sunshine, she beckoned to
      Philip. He stooped his ear to her lips, and she whispered, &ldquo;Hush, dearest!
      Never tell any one, for nobody ever knew&mdash;ever dreamt&mdash;but I
      loved your father&mdash;and&mdash;<i>God gave him to me in you.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dear old dove had delivered herself of her last great secret. Philip
      put his lips to her cheek, iced already over the damps and chills of
      death. Then the eyes closed, the sweet old head slid back, the lips
      changed their colour, but still lay open as with a smile. Thus died Auntie
      Nan, peacefully, hopefully, trustfully, almost joyfully, in the fulness of
      her love and of her pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God,&rdquo; thought Philip, &ldquo;let me go on with my task. Give me strength to
      withstand the temptation of love like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her love had tempted him all his life His father had been twenty years
      dead, but she had kept his spirit alive&mdash;his aims, his ambitions, his
      fears, and the lessons of his life. There lay the beginnings of his ruin,
      his degradation, and the first cause of his deep duplicity. He had
      recovered everything that had been lost; he had gained all that his little
      world could give; and what was the worth of it? What was the price he had
      paid for it? &ldquo;What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and
      lose his own soul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip put his lips to the cold forehead. &ldquo;Sweet soul, forgive me! God
      strengthen me! Let me not fail at this last moment.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Philip did not go back to Elm Cottage. He buried Auntie Nan at the foot of
      his father's grave. There was no room at either side, his mother's sunken
      grave being on the left and the railed tomb of his grandfather on the
      right. They had to remove a willow two feet nearer to the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all was over he returned home alone, and spent the afternoon in
      gathering up Auntie Nan's personal belongings, labelling some of them and
      locking them up in the blue room. The weather had been troubled for some
      days. Spots had been seen on the sun. There were magnetic disturbances,
      and on the night before the aurora had pulsed in the northern sky. When
      the sun was near to sinking there was a brilliant lower sky to the west,
      with a bank of rolling cloud above it like a thick thatch roof, and a
      shaft of golden light dipping down into the sea, as if an angel had opened
      a door in heaven. After the sun had gone a fiery red bar stretched across
      the sky, and there were low rumblings of thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pausing in his work to look out on the beach, Philip saw a man riding hard
      on horseback. It was a messenger from Government Offices. He drew up at
      the gate. A moment later the messenger was in Philip's room handing him a
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      If anybody had seen the Deemster as he took that letter he must have
      thought it his death-warrant. A deadly pallor came to his face when he
      broke the seal of the envelope and drew out the contents. It was a
      commission from the Home Office. Philip was appointed Governor of the Isle
      of Man. &ldquo;My punishment, my punishment!&rdquo; he thought. The higher he rose,
      the lower he had to fall. It was a cruel kindness, a painful distinction,
      an awful penalty. Truly the steps of this Calvary were steep. Would he
      ever ascend it?
    </p>
    <p>
      The messenger was bowing and smirking before him. &ldquo;Thousand
      congratulations, your Excellency!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my lad. Go downstairs. They'll give you something to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later Jem-y-Lord came into the room on some pretence and hopped
      about like a bird. &ldquo;Yes, your Excellency&mdash;No, your Excellency&mdash;Quite
      so, your Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martha came next, and met Philip on the landing with a courageous smile
      and a courtesy. And the whole house, lately so dark and sad, seemed to
      lighten and to laugh, as when, after a sleepless night, you look, and lo!
      the daylight is on the blind; you listen and the birds are twittering in
      their cages below the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>She</i> will hear it too,&rdquo; thought Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote her two lines of a letter, the first that he had penned since his
      illness&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Keep up heart, dear; I will be with you soon.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This, without signature or superscription, he put into an envelope, and
      addressed. Then he went out and posted it himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was lightning as he returned. He felt as if he would like to wander
      away in it down to Port Mooar, and round by the caves, and under the
      cliffs, where the sea-birds scream.

    <h2>
      XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The night had fallen, and he was sitting in his room, when there was a
      clamour of loud voices in the hall. Some one was calling for the Deemster.
      It was Nancy Joe. She was newly returned from Sulby. Something had
      happened to Cæsar, and nobody could control him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to him, your Honour,&rdquo; she cried from the doorway. &ldquo;It's only yourself
      that has power with him, and we don't know in the world what's doing on
      the man. He's got a ram's horn at him, and is going blowing round the
      house like the mischief, calling on the Lord to bring it down, and saying
      it's the walls of Jericho.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip sent for a carriage, and set off for Sulby immediately. The storm
      had increased by this time. Loud peals of thunder echoed in the hills.
      Forks of lightning licked the trunks of the trees and ran like serpents
      along the branches. As they were going by the church at Lezayre, the
      coachman reached over from the box, and said, &ldquo;There's something going
      doing over yonder, sir. See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A bright gleam lit up the dark sky in the direction they were taking. At
      the turn of the road by the &ldquo;Ginger,&rdquo; somebody passed them running.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's yonder?&rdquo; called the coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a voice out of the darkness answered him, &ldquo;The 'Fairy' is struck by
      lightning, and Cæsar's gone mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the fact. While Cæsar in his mania had been blowing his ram's horn
      around his public-house under the delusion that it was Jericho, the
      lightning had struck it. The fire was past all hope of subduing. A great
      hole had been burnt into the roof, and the flames were leaping through it
      as through a funnel. All Sulby seemed to be on the spot. Some were
      dragging furniture out of the burning house; others were running with
      buckets to the river and throwing water on the blazing thatch.
    </p>
    <p>
      But encircling everything was the figure of a man going round and round
      with great plunging strides, over the road, across the river, and through
      the mill-pond behind, blowing a horn in fierce, unearthly blasts, and
      crying in a voice of triumph and mockery, first to this worker and then to
      that, &ldquo;No use, I tell thee. Thou can never put it out. It's fire from
      heaven. Didn't I say I'd bring it down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Cæsar. His eyes glittered, his mouth worked convulsively, and his
      cheeks were as black with the flying soot as the &ldquo;colley&rdquo; of the pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he saw Philip, he came up to him with a terrible smile on his fierce
      black face, and, pointing to the house, he cried above the babel of
      voices, the roar of the thunder, and crackle of the fire, &ldquo;An unclean
      spirit lived in it, sir. It has been tormenting me these ten years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to listen and to hear something. &ldquo;That's it roaring,&rdquo; he cried,
      and then he laughed with wild delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compose yourself, Mr. Cregeen,&rdquo; said Philip, and he tried to take him by
      the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cæsar broke away, blew a terrific blast on his ram's horn, and went
      striding round the house again. When he came back the next time there was
      a deep roll of thunder in the air, and he said, &ldquo;It's the Ballawhaine. He
      had the stone five years, and he used to groan so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Philip entreated him to compose himself. It was useless. Round and
      round the burning house he went, blowing his horn, and calling on the
      workers to stop their ungodly labour, for the Lord had told him to blow
      down the walls of Jericho, and he had burnt them down instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people began to be afraid of his frenzy. &ldquo;They'll have to put the man
      in the Castle,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;Or have him chained up in an outhouse,&rdquo; said
      another. &ldquo;They kept the Kirk Maug-hold lunatic fifteen years on the straw
      in the gable loft, and his children in the house grew up to be men and
      women.&rdquo; &ldquo;It's the girl that's doing on Cæsar. Shame on the daughters that
      bring ruin to their old fathers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Cæsar went careering round the fire, blowing his ram's horn and
      crying, &ldquo;No use! It's the Lord God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The more the fire blazed, the more it resisted the efforts of the people
      to subdue it, the more fierce and unearthly were Cæsar's blasts and the
      more triumphant his cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Grannie stepped out and stopped him. &ldquo;Come home, father,&rdquo; she
      whimpered. He looked at her with bewildered eyes, then he looked at the
      burning house, and he seemed to recover himself in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come home, bogh,&rdquo; said Grannie tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got no home,&rdquo; said Cæsar in a helpless way. &ldquo;And I've got no money.
      The fire has taken all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter, father,&rdquo; said Grannie. &ldquo;We had nothing when we began; we'll
      begin again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Cæsar fell to mumbling texts of Scripture, and Grannie to soothing
      him after her simple fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'My soul is passing through deep waters. I am feeble and sore broken.
      Save me, O God, for the waters are come in unto my soul, I sink in deep
      mire, where there is no standing.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, no Cæsar, we're on the road now. It's dry enough here, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Many bulls have compassed me; great bulls of Bashan have beset me round.
      Save me from the lion's mouth; for Thou hast heard me from the horns of
      the unicorn.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the lion and the unicorn, father, but come and we'll change
      thy wet trousers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be
      whiter than snow.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, yes, we'll wash thee enough when we get to Ramsey. Come, then, bogh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had dropped his ram's horn somewhere, and she took him by the hand.
      Then he suffered himself to be led away, and the two old children went off
      into the darkness.

    <h2>
      XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was a letter waiting for Philip at home. It was from the Clerk of
      the Rolls. Only a few lines scribbled on the back of a draft deposition,
      telling him the petition for divorce had been heard that day within closed
      doors. The application had been granted, and all was settled and
      comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to hurt your already much wounded feelings, Christian,&rdquo;
       wrote the Clerk of the Rolls, &ldquo;or to add anything to your responsibility
      when you come to make provision for the woman, but I must say she has
      given up for your sake a deuced good honest fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Philip aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I told him that all was over, and that his erring wife would trouble
      him no more, I thought he was going to burst out crying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Philip had no time yet to think of Pete. All his heart was with Kate.
      She would receive the official intimation of the divorce, and it would
      fall on her in her prison like a blow. She would think of herself, with
      all the world against her, and of him with all the world at his feet. He
      wanted to run to her, to pluck her up in his arms, to kiss her on the
      lips, and say, &ldquo;Mine, mine at last!&rdquo; His wife&mdash;her husband&mdash;all
      forgiven&mdash;all forgotten!
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip spent the rest of the night in writing a letter to Kate. He told
      her he could not live without her; that now for the first time she was
      his, and he was hers, and they were one; that their love was re-born, and
      that he would spend the future in atoning for the wrongs he had inflicted
      upon her in the past. Then he dropped to the sheer babble of affection and
      poured out his heart to her&mdash;all the babydom of love, the foolish
      prattle, the tender nonsense. What matter that he was Governor now, and
      the first man in the island? He forgot all about it. What matter that he
      was writing to a fallen woman in prison? He only remembered it to forget
      himself the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a little longer, my love, just a little longer. I am coming to you,
      I am coming. Older, perhaps, perhaps sadder, and a boy no more, but
      hopeful still, and ready to face whatever fate befall, with her I love
      beside me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day Jem-y-Lord took this letter to Castle Rushen and brought back an
      answer. It was one line only&mdash;&ldquo;My darling! At last! At last! Oh,
      Philip! Philip! <i>But what about our child?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The proclamation of Philip's appointment as Governor of the Isle of Man
      had been read in the churches, and nailed up on the doors of the
      Court-houses, and the Clerk of the Rolls was pushing on the arrangements
      for the installation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it be on the Tuesday of Easter week,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;and of course at
      Castle Rushen. The retiring Governor is ready to return for that day to
      deliver up his seals of office and to receive your commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P. S.&mdash;Private. And if you think that soft-voiced girl has been long
      enough 'At Her Majesty's pleasure,' I will release her. Not that she is
      taking any harm at all, but we had better get these little accounts
      squared off before your great day comes. Meantime you may wish to provide
      for her future. Be liberal, Christian; you can afford to treat her
      liberally. But what am I saying? Don't I know that you will be
      ridiculously over-generous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip answered this letter promptly. &ldquo;The Tuesday of Easter week will do
      as well as any other day. As to the lady, let her stay where she is until
      the morning of the ceremony, when I will myself settle everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip's correspondence was now plentiful, and he had enough work to cope
      with it The four towns of the island vied with each other in efforts to
      show him honour. Douglas, as the scene of his career, wished to entertain
      him at a banquet; Ramsey, as his birthplace, wanted to follow him in
      procession. He declined all invitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in mourning,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;And besides, I am not well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! no,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;nobody shall reproach me when the times comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no pause, no pity, no relenting rest in the world's kindness. It
      began to take shapes of almost fiendish cruelty in his mind, as if the
      devil's own laughter was behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He inquired about Pete. Hardly anybody knew anything; hardly anybody
      cared. The spendthrift had come down to his last shilling, and sold up the
      remainder of his furniture. The broker was to empty the house on Easter
      Tuesday. That was all. Not a word about the divorce. The poor neglected
      victim, forgotten in the turmoil of his wrongdoer's glory, had that last
      strength of a strong man&mdash;the strength to be silent and to forgive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip asked about the child. She was still at Elm Cottage in the care of
      the woman with the upturned nose and the shrill voice. Every night he
      devised plans for getting possession of Kate's little one, and every
      morning he abandoned them, as difficult or cruel or likely to be spurned.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Easter Monday he was busy in his room at Ballure, with a mounted
      messenger riding constantly between his gate and Government offices. He
      had spent the morning on two important letters. Both were to the Home
      Secretary. One was sealed with his seal as Deemster; the other was written
      on the official paper of Government House. He was instructing the
      messenger to register these letters when, through the open door, he heard
      a formidable voice in the hall. It was Pete's voice. A moment afterwards
      Jem-y-Lord came up with a startled face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's here himself, your Excellency. Whatever <i>am</i> I to do with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring him up,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jem began to stammer. &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;and then the Bishop may be here
      any minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask the Bishop to wait in the room below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete was heard coming upstairs. &ldquo;Aisy all, aisy! Stoop your lil head,
      bogh. That's the ticket!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip had not spoken to Pete since the night of the drinking of the
      brandy and water in the bedroom. He could not help it&mdash;his hand
      shook. There would be a painful scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stoop again, darling. There you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then Pete was in the room. He was carrying the child on one shoulder;
      they were both in their best clothes. Pete looked older and somewhat
      thinner; the tan of his cheeks was fretted out in pale patches under the
      eyes, which were nevertheless bright. He had the face of a man who had
      fought a brave fight with life and been beaten, yet bore the world no
      grudge. Jem-y-Lord and the messenger were gone from the room in a moment,
      and the door was closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d'ye think of that, Phil? Isn't she a lil beauty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete was dancing the child on his knee and looking sideways down at it
      with eyes of rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's as sweet as an angel,&rdquo; said Philip in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't she now?&rdquo; said Pete, and then he rattled on as if he were the
      happiest man alive. &ldquo;You've been wanting something like this yourself this
      long time, Phil. 'Deed you have, though. It would be diverting you
      wonderful. Ter'ble the fun there is in babies. Talk about play-actorers!
      They're only funeral mutes where babies come. Bittending this and
      bittending that&mdash;it's mortal amusing they are. You'd be getting up
      from your books, tired shocking, and ready for a bit of fun, and going to
      the stair-head and shouting down, 'Where's my lil woman?' Then up she'd be
      coming, step by step, houlding on to the bannisters, dot and carry one.
      And my gracious, the dust there'd be here in the study! You down on the
      carpet on all fours, and the lil one straddled across your back and
      slipping down to your neck. Same for all the world as the man in the
      picture with the world atop of his shoulders. And your own lil world would
      be up there, too, laughing and crowing mortal. And then at night, Phil, at
      night&mdash;getting up from your summonses and your warrantees, and going
      creeping to the lil one's room tippie-toe, tippie-toe, and 'Is she
      sleeping comfor'bly?' thinks you; and listening at the crack of the door,
      and hearing her breathing, and slipping in to look, and everything quiet,
      and the red fire on her lil face, and 'Grod bless her, the darling!' says
      you, and then back to your desk content. Aw, you'll have to be having a
      lil one of your own one of these days, Phil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has come to say something,&rdquo; thought Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child wriggled off Pete's knee and began to creep about the floor.
      Philip tried to command himself and to talk easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how have you been yourself, Pete?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Pete, meddling with his hair, &ldquo;only middling, somehow.&rdquo; He
      looked down at the carpet, and faltered, &ldquo;You'll be wondering at me, Phil,
      but, you see &ldquo;&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;not to tell you a word of a lie&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       then, with a rush, &ldquo;I'm going foreign again; that's the fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am,&rdquo; said Pete, looking ashamed. &ldquo;Yes, truth enough, that's what
      I'm thinking of doing. You see,&rdquo; with a persuasive air, &ldquo;when a man's
      bitten by travel it's like the hydrophobia ezactly, he can't rest no time
      in one bed at all. Must be running here and running there&mdash;and
      running reg'lar. It's the way with me, anyway. Used to think the ould
      island would be big enough for the rest of my days. But, no! I'm longing
      shocking for the mines again, and the compound, and the niggers, and the
      wild life out yonder. 'The sea's calling me,' you know.&rdquo; And then he
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip understood him&mdash;Pete meant to take himself out of the way.
      &ldquo;Shall you stay long?&rdquo; he faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, I was thinking so,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;You see, the stuff isn't
      panning out now same as it used to, and fortunes aren't made as fast as
      they were in my time. Not that I'm wanting a fortune, neither&mdash;is it
      likely now? But, still and for all&mdash;well, I'll be away a good spell,
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip tried to ask if he intended to go soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, sir, by the packet to Liverpool, for the sailing on Wednesday.
      I've been going the rounds saying 'goodbye' to the ould chums&mdash;Jonaique,
      and John the Widow, and Niplightly, and Kelly the postman. Not much heart
      at some of them; just a bit of a something stowed away in their giblets;
      but it isn't right to be expecting too much at all. This is the only one
      that doesn't seem willing to part with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete's dog had followed him into the room, and was sitting soberly by the
      side of his chair. &ldquo;There's no shaking him off, poor ould chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog got up and wagged his stump.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we've tramped the world together, haven't we, Dempster? He doesn't
      seem tired of me yet neither.&rdquo; Pete's face lengthened. &ldquo;But there's
      Grannie, now. The ould angel is going about like a bit of a thunder-cloud,
      and doesn't know in the world whether to burst on me or not. Thinks I've
      been cruel, seemingly. I can't be explaining to her neither. Maybe you'll
      set it right for me when I'm gone, sir. It's you for a job like that, you
      know. Don't want her to be thinking hard of me, poor ould thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete whistled at the child, and halloed to it, and then, in a lower tone,
      he continued, &ldquo;Not been to Castletown, sir. Got as far as Ballasalla, and
      saw the castle tower. Then my heart was losing me, and I turned back.
      You'll say good-bye for me, Phil Tell her I forgave&mdash;no, not that,
      though. Say I left her my love&mdash;that won't do neither. <i>You'll</i>
      know best what to say when the time comes, Phil, so I lave it with you.
      Maybe you'll tell her I went away cheerful and content, and, well, happy&mdash;why
      not? No harm in saying that at all. Not breaking my heart, anyway, for
      when a man's a man&mdash;H'm!&rdquo; clearing his throat, &ldquo;I'm bad dreadful
      these days wanting a smook in the mornings. May I smook here? I may?
      You're good, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He cut his tobacco with his discoloured knife, rolled it, charged his
      pipe, and lit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to be going away just before your own great day, Phil. I'll get the
      skipper to fire a round as we're steaming by Castletown, and if there's a
      band aboord I'll tip them a trifle to play 'Myle Charaine.' That'll spake
      to you like the blackbird's whistle, as the saying is. Looks like
      deserting you, though. But, chut! it would be no surprise to me at all.
      I've seen it coming these years and years. 'You'll be the first Manxman
      living,' says I the day I sailed before. You've not deceaved me neither.
      D'ye remember the morning on the quay, and the oath between the pair of
      us? Me swearing you same as a high bailiff&mdash;nothing and nobody to
      come between us&mdash;d'ye mind it, Phil? And nothing has, and nothing
      shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He puffed at his pipe, and said significantly, &ldquo;You'll be getting married
      soon. Aw, you will, I know you will, I'm sarten sure you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip could not look into his face. He felt little and mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a wise man, sir, and a great man, but if a plain common chap may
      give you a bit of advice&mdash;aw, but you'll be losing no time, though,
      I'll not be here myself to see it. I'll be on the water, maybe, with the
      waves washing agen the gun'ale, and the wind rattling in the rigging, and
      the ship burrowing into the darkness of the sea. But I'll be knowing it's
      morning at home, and the sun shining, and a sort of a warm quietness
      everywhere, and you and her at the ould church together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pipe was puffing audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her I lave her my blessing. Tell her&mdash;but the way I'm smooking,
      it's shocking. Your curtains will be smelling thick twist for a century.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip's moist eyes were following the child along the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the little one?&rdquo; he asked with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah I tell you the truth, Phil, that's the for I came. Well, mostly,
      anyway. You see, a child isn't fit for a compound ezactly. Not but they're
      thinking diamonds of a lil thing out there, specially if it's a girl. But
      still and for all, with niggers about and chaps as rough as a thornbush
      and no manners to spake of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip interrupted eagerly&mdash;&ldquo;Will you leave her with Grannie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, that wasn't what I was thinking. Grannie's a bit ould getting
      and she's had her whack. Wanting aisement in her ould days, anyway. Then
      she'll be knocking under before the lil one's up&mdash;that's only to be
      expected. No, I was thinking&mdash;what d'ye think I was thinking now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Philip with quick-coming breath. He did not raise his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking&mdash;well, yes, I was, then&mdash;it's a fact, though&mdash;I
      was thinking maybe yourself, now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip had started up and grasped Pete by the hand, but he could say no
      more, he felt crushed by Pete's magnanimity. And Pete went on as if he
      were asking a great favour. &ldquo;'She's been your heart's blood to you, Pete,'
      thinks I to my-. self, 'and there isn't nobody but himself you could trust
      her with&mdash;nobody else you would give her up to. He'll love her,'.
      thinks I; 'he'll cherish her; he'll rear her as if she was his own; he'll
      be same thing as a father itself to her'&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was struggling to keep up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been laving something for her too,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, though, one of the first Manx estates going. Cæsar had the deeds,
      but I've been taking them to the High Bailiff, and doing everything
      regular. When I'm gone, sir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip tried to protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, but a man can lave what he likes to his own, sir, can't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was silent. He could say nothing. The make-believe was to be kept
      up to the last tragic moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And out yonder, lying on my hunk in the sheds&mdash;good mattresses and
      thick blankets, Phil, nothing to complain of at all&mdash;I'll be watching
      her growing up, year by year, same as if she was under my eye constant.
      'She's in pinafores now' thinks I. 'Now she's in long frocks, and is doing
      up her hair.' 'She's as straight as an osier now, and red as a rose, and
      the best looking girl in the island, and the spitting picture of what her
      mother used to be.' Aw, I'll be seeing her in my mind's eye, sir, plainer
      nor any potegraph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete puffed furiously at his pipe. &ldquo;And the mother, I'll be seeing
      herself, too. A woman every inch of her, God bless her. Wherever there's a
      poor girl lying in her shame she'll be there, I'll go bail on that. And
      yourself&mdash;I'll be seeing yourself, sir, whiter, maybe, and the sun
      going down on you, but strong for all. And when any poor fellow has had a
      knock-down blow, and the world is darkening round him, he'll be coming to
      you for light and for strength, and you'll be houlding out the right hand
      to him, because you're knowing yourself what it is to fall and get up
      again, and because you're a man, and Grod has made friends with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete rammed his thumb into his pipe, and stuffed it, still smoking, into
      his waistcoat pocket. &ldquo;Chut!&rdquo; he said huskily. &ldquo;The talk a man'll be
      putting out when he's going away foreign! All for poethry then, or
      something of that spacious. H'm! h'm!&rdquo; clearing his throat, &ldquo;must be
      giving up the pipe, though. Not much worth for the voice at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip could not speak. The strength and grandeur of the man overwhelmed
      him. It cut him to the heart that Pete could never see, could never hear,
      how he would wash away his shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child had crawled across the room to an open cabinet that stood in one
      corner, and there possessed herself of a shell, which she was making show
      of holding to her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, did you ever?&rdquo; cried Pete. &ldquo;Look at that child now. She's knowing
      it's a shell. 'Deed she is, though. Aw, crawling reg'lar, sir, morning to
      night. Would you like to see the prettiest sight in the world, Phil?&rdquo; He
      went down on his knees and held out his arms. &ldquo;Come here, you lil
      sandpiper. Fix that chair a piece nearer, sir&mdash;that's the ticket.
      Good thing Nancy isn't here. She'd be on to us like the mischief.
      Wonderful handy with babies, though, and if anybody was wanting a nurse
      now&mdash;a stepmother's breath is cold&mdash;but Nancy! My gough, you
      daren't look over the hedge at her lammie but she's shouting fit for an
      earth wake. Stand nice, now, Kitty, stand nice, bogh! The woman's about
      right, too&mdash;the lil one's legs are like bits of qualebone. 'Come,
      now, bogh, come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete put the child to stand with its back to the chair, and then leaned
      towards it with his arms outspread. The child staggered a step in the sea
      of one yard's space that lay between, looked back at the irrecoverable
      chair, looked down on the distant ground, and then plunged forward with a
      nervous laugh, and fell into Pete's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo! Wasn't that nice, Phil? Ever see anything prettier than a child's
      first step? Again, Kitty, bogh! But go to your <i>new</i> father this
      time. Aisy, now, aisy!&rdquo; (in a thick voice). &ldquo;Grive me a kiss first!&rdquo; (with
      a choking gurgle). &ldquo;One more, darling!&rdquo; (with a broken laugh). &ldquo;Now face
      the <i>other</i> way. One&mdash;two&mdash;are you ready, Phil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil held out his long white trembling hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; with a smothered sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three&mdash;four&mdash;and away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child's fingers slipped into Philip's palm; there was another halt,
      another plunge, another nervous laugh, and then the child was in Philip's
      arms, his head was over it, and he was clasping it to his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment, Philip, without raising his eyes, said, &ldquo;Pete!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Pete had stolen softly from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete! where are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Where was he? He was on the road outside, crying like a boy&mdash;no, like
      a man&mdash;at thought of the happiness he had left upstairs.

    <h2>
      XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The town of Peel was in a great commotion that night. It was the night of
      St. Patrick's Day, and the mackerel fleet were leaving for Kinsale. A
      hundred and fifty boats lay in the harbour, each with a light in its
      binnacle, a fire in its cabin, smoke coming from its stove-pipe, and its
      sails half-set. The sea was fresh; there was a smart breeze from the
      northwest, and the air was full of the brine. At the turn of the tide the
      boats began to drop down the harbour. Then there was a rush of women and
      children and old men to the end of the pier. Mothers were seeing their
      sons off, women their husbands, children their fathers, girls their boys&mdash;all
      full of fun and laughter and joyful cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the girls remembered that the men were leaving the island before
      the installation of the new Governor. Straightway they started a game of
      make-believe&mdash;the make-believe of electing the Governor for
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you voting for, Mr. Quayle?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Aw, Dempster Christian, of
      coorse.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Throw us your rope, then, and we'll give you a pull.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Heave
      oh, girls.&rdquo; And the rope would be whipped round a mooring-post on the
      quay, twenty girls would seize it, and the boat would go slipping past the
      pier, round the castle rocks, and then away before the north-wester like a
      gull.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good luck, Harry!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Whips of money coming home, Jem!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Write
      us a letter&mdash;mind you write, now Î &ldquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Goodnight, father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No crying yet, no sign of tears&mdash;nothing but fresh young faces,
      bright eyes, and peals of laughter, as one by one the boats slid out into
      the fresh, green water of the bay, and the wind took them, and they shot
      into the night. Even the dogs on the quay frisked about, and barked as if
      they were going crazy with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this happy scene, a man, wearing a monkey-jacket and a
      wide-brimmed soft hat, came up to the harbour with a little misshapen dog
      at his heels. He stood for a moment as if bewildered by the strange
      midnight spectacle before him. Then he walked through the throng of young
      people, and listened awhile to their talk and laughter. No one spoke to
      him, and he spoke to no one. His dog followed with its nose at his ankles.
      If some other dog, in youthful frolic, frisked and barked about it, it
      snarled and snapped, and then croodled down at his master's feet and
      looked ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dempster, Dempster, getting a bit ould, eh?&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little while he went quietly away. Nobody missed him; nobody had
      observed him. He had gone back to the town. At a baker's shop, which was
      still open for the convenience of the departing fleet, he bought a
      seaman's biscuit. With this he returned to the harbour by way of the
      shore. At the slip by the Rocket House he went down to the beach and
      searched among the shingle until he found a stone like a dumb-bell, large
      at the ends and narrow in the middle. Then he went back to the quay. The
      dog followed him and watched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last of the boats was out in the bay by this time. She could be seen
      quite plainly in the moonlight, with the green blade of a wave breaking on
      her quarter. Somebody was carrying a light on her deck, and the giant
      shadow of a man's figure was cast up on the new lugsail. There were shouts
      and answers across the splashing water. Then a fresh young voice on the
      boat began to sing &ldquo;Lovely Mona, fare thee well.&rdquo; The women took it up,
      and the two companies sang it in turns, verse by verse, the women on the
      quay and the men on the boat, with the sea growing wider between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old fisherman on the skirts of the crowd had a little girl on his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll not be going to Kinsale this time, mate?&rdquo; said a voice behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, no, sir. I've seen the day, though. Thirty years I was going, and
      better. But I'm done now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's the way, you see. It's the turn of the young ones now. Let
      them sing, God bless them! We're not going to fret, though, are we?
      There's one thing we can always do&mdash;we can always remember, and
      that's some constilation, isn't it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm doing it reg'lar.&rdquo; said the old fisherman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, it's been a good thing to live, and when a man's time comes
      it'll not be such a darned bad thing to die neither. Don't you hould with
      me there, mate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, sir, I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last boat had rounded the castle rock, and its topsail had diminished
      and disappeared. On the quay the song had ended, and the women and
      children were turning their faces with a shade of sadness towards the
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; with a deep universal inspiration, &ldquo;wasn't it beautiful?&rdquo;&mdash;
      &ldquo;Wasn't it?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Then what are you crying about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girls laughed at each other with wet eyes, and went off with
      springless steps. The mothers picked up their children and carried them
      home whimpering; and the old men went a way with drooping heads and
      shambling feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all was gone, and the harbour-master had taken his last look round,
      the man with the dog went to the end of the empty quay, and sat on the
      mooring post that had served for the running of the ropes. All was quiet
      enough now. The voices, the singing, the laughter were lost. There was no
      sound but the gurgle of the ebbing tide, which was racing out with the
      river's flow between the pier and the castle rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked at his dog, stooped to it, gave it the biscuit, and petted
      it and stroked it while it munched its supper. &ldquo;Dempster, bogh! Dempster!
      Getting ould, eh? Travelled far together, haven't we? Tired a bit, aren't
      you? Couldn't go through another rough journey, anyway. Hard to part,
      though, Machree! Machree!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the stone out of his pocket, tied it to one end of the string,
      made a noose on the ether end, slipped it about the dog's neck, and
      without warning, picked up the dog and stone at once, and dropped them
      over the pier. The old creature gave a piteous cry as it descended; there
      was a splash, and then&mdash;the racing of the water past the pier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man had turned away quickly, and was going heavily along the quay.

    <h2>
      XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It had been a night of pain to Philip. All the world seemed to be
      conspiring to hold him back from what he had to do. &ldquo;Thou shalt not&rdquo; was
      the legend that appeared to be written everywhere. Four persons had learnt
      his secret, and all four seemed to call upon him to hide it. First, the
      Clerk of the Rolls, who had heard the divorce proceedings within closed
      doors; next Pete, who might have clamoured the scandal on all hands, and
      plucked him down from his place, but had chosen to be silent and to slip
      away unseen; then Cæsar, whose awful self-deception was an assurance of
      his secrecy; and, finally. Auntie Nan, whose provision for Kate's material
      welfare had been intended to prevent the necessity for revelation. All
      these had seemed to say to him, whether from affection or from fear, &ldquo;Hold
      your peace. Say nothing. The past is the past; it is dead; it does not
      exist. Go on with your career. It is only beginning. What right have you
      to break it up? The island looks to you, waits for you. Step forward and
      be strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thank God, it was too late to be moved by that temptation. Too late to be
      bought by that bribe. Already he had taken the irrevocable course, he had
      made the irrevocable step. He could not now go back.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the awful penalty of the island's undeceiving! The pain of that moment
      when everybody would learn that he had deceived the whole world! He was a
      sham&mdash;a whited sepulchre. Every step he had gone up in his quick
      ascent had been over the body of some one who had loved him too well.
      First Kate, who had been the victim of the Deemstership, and now Pete, who
      was paying the price that made him Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could see the darkened looks of the proud; he could hear the execration
      of the disappointed; he could feel the tears of the true-hearted at the
      downfall of a life that had looked so fair. In the frenzy of that last
      hour of trial, it seemed as if he was contending, not with man and the
      world, but with the devil, who was using both to make this bitter irony of
      his position&mdash;who was bribing him with worldly glory that he might
      damn his soul forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      And therein lay a temptation that sat closer at his side&mdash;the
      temptation to turn his face and fly away. It was midnight. The moon was
      shining on the boundless plain of the sea. He was in the slack water of
      the soul, when the ebb is spent, before the tide has begun to flow. Oh, to
      leave everything behind&mdash;the shame and the glory together!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the moment when the girls on Peel Quay were pulling the rope for
      the men on the boats who were ready to vote for Christian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pains of sleep were yet greater. He thought he was in Castletown,
      skulking under the walls of the castle. With a look up towards Parliament
      House and down to the harbour, he fumbled his private key into the lock of
      the side entrance to the council chamber. The old caretaker heard him
      creep-down the long corridor, and she came clattering out with a candle,
      shaded behind her hand. &ldquo;Something I've forgotten,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Pardon, your
      Honour,&rdquo; and then a deep courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened noiselessly the little door leading from the council chamber to
      the keep, but in the dark shadow of the steps the turnkey challenged him.
      &ldquo;Who's there? Stop!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The Deemster! Beg your Honour's
      pardon.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Show me the female wards.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;This way your Honour.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Her
      cell.&rdquo; &ldquo;Here, your Honour.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The key; your lantern. Now go back to
      the guard-room.&rdquo; He was with Kate. &ldquo;My love, my love!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;My darling!&rdquo;&mdash;
      &ldquo;Come, let us fly away from the island. I cannot face it. I thought I
      could, but I cannot. I've got the child too. Come!&rdquo; And then Kate&mdash;&ldquo;I
      would go anywhere with you, Philip, anywhere, anywhere. I only want your
      love. But is this worthy of a man like you? Leave me. We have fallen too
      low to drop into a pit like that. Away with you! Go!&rdquo; And he slunk out of
      the cell, before the wrathful love that would save him from himself. He,
      the Deemster, the Governor, had slunk out like a dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only a dream. When he awoke, the birds were singing and the day was
      blue over the sea. The temptation was past; it was under his feet. He
      could hesitate no longer; his cup was brimming over; he would drink it to
      the dregs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jem-y-Lord came with his mouth full of news. The town was decorated with
      bunting. There was to be a general holiday. A grand stand had been erected
      on the green in front of the Court-house. The people were not going to be
      deterred by the Deemster's refusals. He who shrank from honours was the
      more worthy of being honoured. They intended to present their new Governor
      with an address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them&mdash;let them,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jem looked up inquiringly. His master's face had a strange expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I drive you to-day, your Excellency?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lad. It may be for the last time, Jemmy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What was amiss with the Governor? Had the excitement proved too much for
      him?

    <h2>
      XXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a perfect morning, soft and fresh, and sweet with the odours and
      the colours of spring. New gorse flashed from the hedges, the violets
      peeped from the banks; over the freshening green of the fields the young
      lambs sported, and the lark sang in the thin blue air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town, as they dipped into it, was full of life. At the turn of the
      Court-house the crowd was densest. A policeman raised his hand in front of
      the horses and Jem-y-Lord drew up. Then the High Bailiff stepped to the
      gate and read an address. It mentioned Iron Christian, calling him &ldquo;The
      Great Deemster&rdquo;; the town took pride to itself that the first Manx
      Governor of Man was born in Ramsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip answered briefly, confining himself to an expression of thanks;
      there was great cheering and then the carriage moved on. The journey
      thereafter was one long triumphal passage. At Sulby Street, and at
      Ballaugh Street, there were flags and throngs of people. From time to time
      other carriages joined them, falling into line behind. The Bishop was
      waiting at Bishop's Court, and place was made for his carriage immediately
      after the carriage of the Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Tynwald there was a sweet and beautiful spectacle. The children of St.
      John's were seated on the four rounds of the mount, boys and girls in
      alternate rows, and from that spot, sacred to the memory of their
      forefathers for a thousand years, they sang the National Anthem as Philip
      passed on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unhappy man lay back in his seat. His eyes filled, his throat rose.
      &ldquo;Oh, for what might have been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under Harry Delany's tree a company of fishermen were waiting with a
      letter. It was from their mates at Kinsale. They could not be at home that
      day, but their hearts were there. Every boat would fly her flag at the
      masthead, and at twelve o'clock noon every Manx fisherman on Irish waters
      would raise a cheer. If the Irishmen asked them what they meant by that,
      they would answer and say, &ldquo;It's for the fisherman's friend, Governor
      Philip Christian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unhappy man was no longer in pain. His agony was beyond that. A sort
      of divine madness had taken possession of him. He was putting the world
      and the prince of the world behind his back. All this worldly glory and
      human gratitude was but the temptation of Satan. With God's help he would
      not succumb. He would resist. He would triumph over everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jem-y-Lord twisted on the box-seat. &ldquo;See, your Excellency! Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The flags of Castletown were visible on the Eagle Tower of the castle.
      Then there was a multitudinous murmur. Finally a great shout. &ldquo;Now, boys!
      Three times three! Hip, hip, hurrah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the entrance to the town an evergreen arch had been erected. It bore an
      inscription in Manx: &ldquo;<i>Dooiney Vannin, lhiat myr hoilloo</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Man
      of Man, success as thou deservest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carriage had slacked down to a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive quicker,&rdquo; cried Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The streets are crowded, your Excellency,&rdquo; said Jem-y-Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flags were flying from every window, from every roof, from every
      lamp-post. The people ran by the carriage cheering. Their shout was a
      deafening uproar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip could not respond. &ldquo;<i>She</i> will hear it,&rdquo; he thought. His head
      dropped. He was picturing Kate in her cell with the clamour of his welcome
      coming muffled through the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took the road by the harbour. Suddenly the carriage stopped. The men
      were taking the horses out of the shafts. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had an impulse to alight, but the carriage was moving again in a
      moment. &ldquo;It is the last of my punishment,&rdquo; he thought, and again fell
      back. Then the shouting and the laughter ran along the quay with the
      crackle and roar of a fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      A regiment of soldiers lined the way from the drawbridge to the
      porlcullis. As the carriage drew up, they presented arms in royal salute.
      At the same moment the band of the regiment inside the Keep played &ldquo;God
      save the Queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The High Bailiff of the town opened the carriage-door and presented an
      address. It welcomed the new Governor to the ancient castle wherein his
      predecessors had been installed, and took fresh assurance of devotion to
      the Crown from the circumstance that one of their own countrymen had been
      thought worthy to represent it. No Manxman had ever been so honoured in
      that island before since the days of the new Governor's own great kinsman,
      familiarly and affectionately known to all Manxmen through two centuries
      as Illiam Dhone (Brown William).
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip replied in few words, the cheering broke out afresh, the band
      played again, and they entered the castle by the long corridor that led to
      the council chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an anteroom the officials were waiting. They were all elderly men and
      old men, who had seen long and honourable service, but they showed no
      jealousy. The Clerk of the Rolls received bis former pupil with a shout
      wherein personal pride struggled with respect, and affection with
      humility. Then the Attorney-General welcomed him in the name of the Bar,
      as head of the Judicature, as well as head of the Legislature, taking joy
      in the fact that one of their own profession had been elevated to the
      highest office in the Isle of Man; glancing at his descent from an
      historic Manx line, at his brief but distinguished career as judge, which
      had revived the best traditions of judicial wisdom and eloquence, and
      finally wishing him long life and strength for the fulfilment of the noble
      promise of his young and spotless manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Attorney-General,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;I will not accept your
      congratulations, much as it would rejoice my heart to do so. It would only
      be another grief to me if you were to repent, as too soon you may, the
      generous warmth of your reception.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were puzzled looks, but the sage counsellors could not receive the
      right impression; they could only understand the reply in the sense that
      agreed with their present feelings. &ldquo;It is beautiful,&rdquo; they whispered,
      &ldquo;when a young man of real gifts is genuinely modest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;I must go into my room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Clerk of the Rolls followed him, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! poor Tom Christian would have been a proud man this day&mdash;prouder
      than if the honour had been his own&mdash;ten thousand thousand times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have mercy, have mercy, and leave me alone,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean to offend you, Christian,&rdquo; said the Clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip put one hand affectionately on his shoulder. The eyes of the
      robustious fellow began to blink, and he returned to his colleagues.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a confused murmur beyond the farther wall of the room. It was
      the room kept for the Deemster when he held court in the council chamber.
      One of its two doors communicated with the bench. As usual, a constable
      kept this door. The man loosened his chain and removed his helmet. His
      head was grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the Court-house full?&rdquo; asked Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The constable put his eye to the eye-hole. &ldquo;Crowded, your Excellency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep the passages clear.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, your Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the Clerk of the Court present?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He is, your Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the jailor?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Downstairs, your Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell both they will be wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The constable turned the key of the door and left the room. Jem-y-Lord
      came puffing and perspiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ex-Governor is coming over by the green, sir. He'll be here in a
      moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wig and gown, Jemmy,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deemster's wig, your Excellency?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last time you'll wear it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last, indeed, my lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a clash of steel outside, followed by the beat of drum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's here,&rdquo; said Jem-y-Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip listened. The rattling noise came to him through opening doors and
      reverberating corridors like the trampling of a wave to a man imprisoned
      in a cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll hear it, too.&rdquo; That thought was with him constantly. In his mind's
      eye he was seeing Kate, crouching in the fire-seat of the palace room that
      was now her prison, and covering her ears to deaden the joyous sounds that
      broke the usual silence of the gloomy walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jem-y-Lord was at the eye-hole of the door. &ldquo;He's coming on to the bench,
      sir. The gentlemen of the council are following him, and the Court-house
      is full of ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was pacing to and fro like a man in violent agitation. At the other
      side of the wall the confused murmur had risen to a sharp crackle of many
      voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The constable came back with the Clerk of the Court and the jailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything ready, your Excellency,&rdquo; said the Clerk of the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The constable turned the key of the door, and laid his hand on the knob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment&mdash;give me a moment,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was going through the last throes of his temptation. Something was
      asking him, as if in tones of indignation, what right he had to bring
      people there to make fools of them. And something was laughing as if in
      mockery at the theatrical device he had chosen for gathering together the
      people of rank and station, and then dismissing them like naughty
      school-children.
    </p>
    <p>
      This idea clamoured loud in wild derision, telling him that he was posing,
      that he was making a market of his misfortune, that he was an actor, and
      that whatever the effect of the scene he was about to perform, it was
      unnecessary and must be contemptible. &ldquo;You talk of your shame and
      humiliation&mdash;no atonement can wipe it out. You came here prating to
      yourself of blotting out the past&mdash;no act of man can do so. Vain,
      vain, and idle as well as vain! Mere mummery and display, and a blow to
      the dignity of justice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under the weight of such torment the thought came to him that he should go
      through the ceremony after all, that he should do as the people expected,
      that he should accept the Governorship, and then defy the social ostracism
      of the island by making Kate his wife. &ldquo;It's not yet too late,&rdquo; said the
      tempter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip stopped in his walk and remembered the two letters of yesterday.
      &ldquo;Thank God! it <i>is</i> too late,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had spoken the words aloud, and the officers in attendance glanced up
      at him. Jem-y-Lord was behind, trembling and biting his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed too late for that temptation. And then the vanity of it, the
      cruelty and insufficiency of it! He had been a servant of the world long
      enough. From this day forth he meant to be its master. No matter if all
      the devils of hell should laugh at him! He was going through with his
      purpose. There was only one condition on which he could live in the world&mdash;that
      he should renounce it. There was only one way of renouncing the world&mdash;to
      return its wages and strip off its livery. His sin was not only against
      Kate, against Pete; it was against the island, and the island must set him
      free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip approached the door, slackened his pace with an air of uncertainty;
      at one step from the constable he stopped. He was breathing noisily. If
      the officers had observed him at that moment they must have thought he
      looked like a man going to execution. But the constable gazed before him
      with a sombre expression, held his helmet in one hand, and the knob of the
      door in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Philip, with a long inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a flash of faces, a waft of perfume, a flutter of
      pocket-handkerchiefs, and a deafening reverberation. Philip was in the
      Court-house.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was remarked that his face was fearfully worn, and that it looked the
      whiter for the white wig above it and the black gown beneath. His large
      eyes flamed as with fire. &ldquo;The sword too keen for the scabbard,&rdquo; whispered
      somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a kind of aloofness in strong men at great moments. Nobody
      approaches them. They move onward of themselves, and stand or fall alone.
      Everybody in court rose as Philip entered, but no one offered his hand.
      Even the ex-Governor only bowed from the Governor's seat under the canopy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip took his customary place as Deemster. He was then at the right of
      the Governor, the Bishop being on the left. Behind the bishop sat the
      Attorney-General, and behind Philip the Clerk of the Rolls. The cheers
      that had greeted Philip on his entrance ended with the clapping of hands,
      and died off like a wave falling back from the shingle. Then he rose and
      turned to the Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know if you are aware, your Excellency, that this is Deemster's
      Court-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor smiled, and a titter went round the court. &ldquo;We will dispense
      with that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have better business this morning.&rdquo; 34
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, your Excellency,&rdquo; said Philip; &ldquo;I am still Deemster. With your
      leave we will do everything according to rule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a slight pause, a questioning look, then a cold answer. &ldquo;Of
      course, if you wish it; but your sense of duty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ladies in the galleries bad ceased to flutter their fans, and the
      members of the House of Keys were shifting in their seats in the well
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Clerk of the Deemster's Court pushed through to the space beneath the
      bench. &ldquo;There is only one case, your Honour,&rdquo; he whispered up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak out, sir,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;What case is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Clerk gave an informal answer. It was the case of the young woman who
      had attempted her life at Ramsey, and had been kept at Her Majesty's
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long has she been in prison?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Seven weeks, your Honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the book and I will sign the order for her release.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The book was handed to the bench. Philip signed it, handed it back to the
      Clerk, and said with his face to the jailor&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But keep her until somebody comes to fetch her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There had been a cold silence during these proceedings. When they were
      over, the ladies breathed freely. &ldquo;You remember the case&mdash;left her
      husband and little child&mdash;divorced since, I'm told&mdash;a worthless
      person.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! yes, wasn't she first tried the day the Deemster fell
      ill in court?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Men are too tender with such creatures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip had risen again. &ldquo;Your Excellency, I have done the last of my
      duties as Deemster.&rdquo; His voice had hoarsened. He was a worn and stricken
      figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ex Governor's warmth had been somewhat cooled by the unexpected
      interruption. Nevertheless, the pock-marks smoothed out of his forehead,
      and he rose with a smile. At the same moment the Clerk of the Rolls
      stepped up and laid two books on the desk before him&mdash;a New Testament
      in a tattered leather binding, and the <i>Liber Juramentorum</i>, the Book
      of Oaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The regret I feel,&rdquo; said the ex-Governor, &ldquo;and feel increasingly, day by
      day, at the severance of the ties which have bound me to this beautiful
      island is tempered by the satisfaction I experience that the choice of my
      successor has fallen upon one whom I know to be a gentleman of powerful
      intellect and stainless honour. He will preserve that autonomous
      independence which has come down to you from a remote antiquity, at the
      same time that he will uphold the fidelity of a people who have always
      been loyal to the Crown. I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may
      attend his administration, and that, if the time ever comes when he too
      shall stand in the position I occupy to-day, he may have recollections as
      lively of the support and kindness he has met with, and regrets as deep at
      his separation from the little Manx nation which he leaves behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the Governor took the staff of office, and gave the signal for
      rising. Everybody rose. &ldquo;And now, sir,&rdquo; he said, turning to Philip with a
      smile, &ldquo;to do everything, as you say, according to rule, let us first take
      Her Majesty's commission of your appointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's pause, and then Philip said in a cold clear voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Excellency, I have no commission. The commission which I received I
      have returned. I have, therefore, no right to be installed as Governor.
      Also, I have resigned my office as Deemster, and, though my resignation
      has not yet been accepted, I am, in reality, no longer in the service of
      the State.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The people looked at the speaker with eyes that were full of the
      stupefaction of surprise. Somebody bad risen at the back of the bench. It
      was the Clerk of the Rolls. He stretched out his hand as if to touch
      Philip on the shoulder. Then he hesitated and sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen of the Council and of the Keys,&rdquo; continued Philip, &ldquo;you will
      think you have assembled to see a man take a leap into an abyss more dark
      than death. That is as it may be. You have a right to an explanation, and
      I am here to make it. What I have done has been at the compulsion of
      conscience. I am not worthy of the office I hold, still less of the office
      that is offered me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a half-articulate interruption from behind Philip's chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! do not think, old friend, that I am dealing in vague self
      depreciation. I should have preferred not to speak more exactly, but what
      must be, must be. Your Excellency has spoken of my honour as spotless.
      Would to God it were so; but it is deeply stained with sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, made an effort to begin afresh, and stopped again. Then, in a
      low tone, with measured utterance, amid breathless silence, he said&mdash;
      &ldquo;I have lived a double life. Beneath the life that you have seen there has
      been another&mdash;God only knows how full of wrongdoing and disgrace and
      shame. It is no part of my duty to involve others in this confession. Let
      it be enough that my career has been built on falsehood and robbery, that
      I have deceived the woman who loved me with her heart of hearts, and
      robbed the man who would have trusted me with his soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The people began to breathe audibly. There was the scraping of a chair
      behind the speaker. The Clerk of the Rolls had risen. His florid face was
      violently agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May it please your Excellency,&rdquo; he began, faltering and stammering, in a
      husky voice, &ldquo;it will be within your Excellency's knowledge, and the
      knowledge of every one on the island, that his Honour has only just risen
      from a long and serious illness, brought on by overwork, by too zealous
      attention to his duties, and that&mdash;in fact, that&mdash;well, not to
      blink the plain truth, that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sigh of immense relief had passed over the court, and the Governor,
      grown very pale, was nodding in assent. But Philip only smiled sadly and
      shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been ill indeed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but not from the cause you speak of.
      The just judgment of God has overtaken me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Clerk of the Rolls sank back into his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The moment came when I had to sit in judgment on my own sin, the moment
      when she who had lost her honour in trusting to mine stood in the dock
      before me. I, who had been the first cause of her misfortunes, sat on the
      bench as her judge. She is now in prison and I am here. The same law which
      has punished her failing with infamy has advanced me to power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an icy quiet in the court, such as comes with the first gleam of
      the dawn. By that quick instinct which takes possession of a crowd at
      great moments, the people understood everything&mdash;the impurity of the
      character that had seemed so pure, the nullity of the life that had seemed
      so noble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I asked myself what there was left to me to do, I could see but one
      thing. It was impossible to go on administering justice, being myself
      unjust, and remembering that higher bar before which I too was yet to
      stand. I must cease to be Deemster. But that was only my protection
      against the future, not my punishment for the past. I could not surrender
      myself to any earthly court, because I was guilty of no crime against
      earthly law. The law cannot take a man into the court of the conscience.
      He must take himself there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped again, and then said quietly, &ldquo;My sentence is this open
      confession of my sin, and renunciation of the worldly advantages which
      have been bought by the suffering of others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was no longer possible to doubt him. He had sinned, and he had reaped
      the reward of his sin. Those rewards were great and splendid, but he had
      come to renounce them all. The dreams of ambition were fulfilled, the
      miracle of life was realised, the world was conquered and at his feet, yet
      he was there to give up all. The quiet of the court had warmed to a hush
      of awe. He turned to the bench, but every face was down. Then his own eyes
      fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen of the Council, you who have served the island so long and so
      honourably, perhaps you blame me for permitting you to come together for
      the hearing of this confession. But if you knew the temptation I was under
      to fly away without making it, to turn my back on my past, to shuffle, my
      fault on to Fate, to lay the blame on Life, to persuade myself that I
      could not have acted differently, you would believe it was not lightly,
      and God knows, not vainly, that I suffered you to come here to see me
      mount my scaffold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned back to the body of the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My countrymen and countrywomen, you who have been so much more kind to me
      than my character justified or my conduct merited. I say good-bye; but not
      as one who is going away. In conquering the impulse to go without
      confessing, I conquered the desire to go at all. Here, where my old life
      has fallen to ruin, my new life must be built up. That is the only
      security. It is also the only justice. On this island, where my fall is
      known, my uprising may come&mdash;as is most right&mdash;only with bitter
      struggle and sorrow and tears. But when it comes, it will come securely.
      It may be in years, in many years, but I am willing to wait&mdash;I am
      ready to labour. And, meantime, she who was worthy of my highest honour
      will share my lowest degradation. That is the way of all women&mdash;God
      love and keep them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The exaltation of his tones infected everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be that you think I am to be pitied. There have been hours of my
      life when I have been deserving of pity. But they have been the hours, the
      dark hours, when, in the prodigality of your gratitude, you have loaded me
      with distinctions, and a shadow has haunted me, saying, 'Philip Christian,
      they think you a just judge&mdash;you are not a just judge; they think you
      an upright man&mdash;you are not an upright man.' Do not pity me now, when
      the dark hours are passed, when the new life has begun, when I am
      listening at length to the voice of my heart, which has all along been the
      voice of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes shone, his mouth was smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you think how narrowly I escaped the danger of letting things go on as
      they were going, of covering up my fault, of concealing my true character,
      of living as a sham and dying as a hypocrite, you will consider me worthy
      of envy instead. Good-bye! good-bye! God bless you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before any one appeared to be aware that his voice had ceased he was gone
      from the bench, and the Deemster's chair stood empty. Then the people
      turned and looked into each other's stricken faces. They were still
      standing, for nobody had thought of sitting down.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no further speaking that day. Without a word or a sign the
      Governor descended from his seat and the proceedings came to an end. Every
      one moved towards the door. &ldquo;A great price to pay for it, though,&rdquo; thought
      the men. &ldquo;How he must have loved her, after all,&rdquo; thought the women.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the big Queen Elizabeth clock of the Castle was striking
      twelve, and the fishermen on Irish waters were raising a cheer for their
      friend at home. A loud detonation rang out over the town. It was the
      report of a gun. There was another, and then a third. The shots were from
      a steamer that was passing the bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip remembered&mdash;it was Pete's last farewell.

    <h2>
      XXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Half an hour later the Keep, the courtyard, and the passage to the
      portcullis were filled with an immense crowd. Ladies thronged the two
      flights of external steps to the prisoners' chapel and the council
      chamber. Men had climbed as high as to the battlements, and were looking
      down over the beetle-browed walls. All eyes were on the door to the
      debtors' side of the prison, and a path from it was being kept clear. The
      door opened and Philip and Kate came out. There was no other exit, and
      they must have taken it. He was holding her firmly by the hand, and
      half-leading, half-drawing her along. Under the weight of so many eyes,
      her head was held down, but those who were near enough to see her face
      knew that her shame was swallowed up in happiness and her fear in love.
      Philip was like a man transfigured. The extreme pallor of his cheeks was
      gone, his step was firm, and his face was radiant. It was the common
      remark that never before had he looked so strong, so buoyant, so noble.
      This was the hour of his triumph, not that within the walls; this, when
      his sin was confessed, when conscience had no power to appal him, when the
      world and the pride of the world were beneath his feet, and he was going
      forth from a prison cell, hand in hand with the fallen woman by his side,
      to face the future with their bankrupt lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she? She was sharing his fiery ordeal. Before her outraged sisters and
      all the world she was walking with him in the depth of his humiliation, at
      the height of his conquest, at the climax of his shame and glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once for a moment she halted and stumbled as if under the hot breath that
      was beating upon her head. But he put his arm about her, and in a moment
      she was strong. The sun dipped down from the great tower on to his
      upturned face, and his eyes were glistening through their tears.
